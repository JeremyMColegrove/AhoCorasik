Book 01        Genesis

01:001:001 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

01:001:002 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was
           upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon
           the face of the waters.

01:001:003 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

01:001:004 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
           light from the darkness.

01:001:005 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called
           Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

01:001:006 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
           waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

01:001:007 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
           under the firmament from the waters which were above the
           firmament: and it was so.

01:001:008 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
           morning were the second day.

01:001:009 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
           together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it
           was so.

01:001:010 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
           of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:011 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
           yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his
           kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

01:001:012 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed
           after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in
           itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:013 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

01:001:014 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the
           heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for
           signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

01:001:015 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
           give light upon the earth: and it was so.

01:001:016 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
           day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars
           also.

01:001:017 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
           upon the earth,

01:001:018 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
           light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:019 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

01:001:020 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
           creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth
           in the open firmament of heaven.

01:001:021 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
           moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their
           kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that
           it was good.

01:001:022 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
           fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the
           earth.

01:001:023 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

01:001:024 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
           after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the
           earth after his kind: and it was so.

01:001:025 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
           after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth
           after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

01:001:026 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our
           likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,
           and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over
           all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth
           upon the earth.

01:001:027 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God
           created he him; male and female created he them.

01:001:028 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
           multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have
           dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
           air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

01:001:029 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing
           seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,
           in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it
           shall be for meat.

01:001:030 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
           and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there
           is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was
           so.

01:001:031 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
           very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

01:002:001 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host
           of them.

01:002:002 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;
           and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he
           had made.

01:002:003 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because
           that in it he had rested from all his work which God created
           and made.

01:002:004 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
           they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth
           and the heavens,

01:002:005 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
           every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had
           not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man
           to till the ground.

01:002:006 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
           face of the ground.

01:002:007 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
           breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became
           a living soul.

01:002:008 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there
           he put the man whom he had formed.

01:002:009 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree
           that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of
           life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of
           knowledge of good and evil.

01:002:010 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
           thence it was parted, and became into four heads.

01:002:011 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth
           the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

01:002:012 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
           onyx stone.

01:002:013 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
           compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

01:002:014 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
           goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is
           Euphrates.

01:002:015 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
           Eden to dress it and to keep it.

01:002:016 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of
           the garden thou mayest freely eat:

01:002:017 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
           not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
           shalt surely die.

01:002:018 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
           alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

01:002:019 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
           field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam
           to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called
           every living creature, that was the name thereof.

01:002:020 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
           and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not
           found an help meet for him.

01:002:021 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
           slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh
           instead thereof;

01:002:022 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
           woman, and brought her unto the man.

01:002:023 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
           flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of
           Man.

01:002:024 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and
           shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

01:002:025 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
           ashamed.

01:003:001 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field
           which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,
           hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

01:003:002 And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit
           of the trees of the garden:

01:003:003 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the
           garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall
           ye touch it, lest ye die.

01:003:004 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

01:003:005 For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your
           eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good
           and evil.

01:003:006 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
           that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to
           make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and
           gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

01:003:007 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
           were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made
           themselves aprons.

01:003:008 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden
           in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves
           from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the
           garden.

01:003:009 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where
           art thou?

01:003:010 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
           afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

01:003:011 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou
           eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou
           shouldest not eat?

01:003:012 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,
           she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

01:003:013 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
           hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
           did eat.

01:003:014 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
           this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast
           of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt
           thou eat all the days of thy life:

01:003:015 And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between
           thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou
           shalt bruise his heel.

01:003:016 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
           thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and
           thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over
           thee.

01:003:017 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the
           voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I
           commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is
           the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all
           the days of thy life;

01:003:018 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and
           thou shalt eat the herb of the field;

01:003:019 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
           return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
           dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

01:003:020 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the
           mother of all living.

01:003:021 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
           skins, and clothed them.

01:003:022 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,
           to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,
           and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

01:003:023 Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,
           to till the ground from whence he was taken.

01:003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the
           garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned
           every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

01:004:001 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,
           and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

01:004:002 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
           sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

01:004:003 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of
           the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

01:004:004 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and
           of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to
           his offering:

01:004:005 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain
           was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

01:004:006 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is
           thy countenance fallen?

01:004:007 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou
           doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be
           his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

01:004:008 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,
           when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel
           his brother, and slew him.

01:004:009 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
           said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?

01:004:010 And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's
           blood crieth unto me from the ground.

01:004:011 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
           mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;

01:004:012 When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield
           unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou
           be in the earth.

01:004:013 And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I
           can bear.

01:004:014 Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the
           earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a
           fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to
           pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.

01:004:015 And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,
           vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a
           mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.

01:004:016 And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in
           the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.

01:004:017 And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and
           he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the
           name of his son, Enoch.

01:004:018 And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and
           Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.

01:004:019 And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
           Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.

01:004:020 And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in
           tents, and of such as have cattle.

01:004:021 And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
           such as handle the harp and organ.

01:004:022 And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every
           artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was
           Naamah.

01:004:023 And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my
           voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have
           slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.

01:004:024 If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and
           sevenfold.

01:004:025 And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called
           his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another
           seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.

01:004:026 And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called
           his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the
           LORD.

01:005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that
           God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;

01:005:002 Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called
           their name Adam, in the day when they were created.

01:005:003 And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in
           his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name
           Seth:

01:005:004 And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight
           hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:

01:005:005 And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty
           years: and he died.

01:005:006 And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:

01:005:007 And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven
           years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:008 And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years:
           and he died.

01:005:009 And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:

01:005:010 And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen
           years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:011 And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and
           he died.

01:005:012 And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:

01:005:013 And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and
           forty years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:014 And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years:
           and he died.

01:005:015 And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:

01:005:016 And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and
           thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:017 And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and
           five years: and he died.

01:005:018 And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat
           Enoch:

01:005:019 And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters:

01:005:020 And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two
           years: and he died.

01:005:021 And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:

01:005:022 And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three
           hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:023 And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five
           years:

01:005:024 And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.

01:005:025 And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and
           begat Lamech.

01:005:026 And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred
           eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:027 And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and
           nine years: and he died.

01:005:028 And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a
           son:

01:005:029 And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort
           us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the
           ground which the LORD hath cursed.

01:005:030 And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and
           five years, and begat sons and daughters:

01:005:031 And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and
           seven years: and he died.

01:005:032 And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,
           and Japheth.

01:006:001 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of
           the earth, and daughters were born unto them,

01:006:002 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were
           fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.

01:006:003 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,
           for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred
           and twenty years.

01:006:004 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after
           that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,
           and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men
           which were of old, men of renown.

01:006:005 And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,
           and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was
           only evil continually.

01:006:006 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth,
           and it grieved him at his heart.

01:006:007 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from
           the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping
           thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I
           have made them.

01:006:008 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.

01:006:009 These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and
           perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.

01:006:010 And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

01:006:011 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was
           filled with violence.

01:006:012 And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;
           for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.

01:006:013 And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before
           me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and,
           behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

01:006:014 Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
           ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.

01:006:015 And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The
           length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth
           of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.

01:006:016 A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou
           finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the
           side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou
           make it.

01:006:017 And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the
           earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,
           from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall
           die.

01:006:018 But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt
           come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy
           sons' wives with thee.

01:006:019 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort
           shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee;
           they shall be male and female.

01:006:020 Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of
           every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every
           sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.

01:006:021 And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou
           shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee,
           and for them.

01:006:022 Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did
           he.

01:007:001 And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into
           the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this
           generation.

01:007:002 Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the
           male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two,
           the male and his female.

01:007:003 Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;
           to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.

01:007:004 For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth
           forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I
           have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.

01:007:005 And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.

01:007:006 And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters
           was upon the earth.

01:007:007 And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
           wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the
           flood.

01:007:008 Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of
           fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,

01:007:009 There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and
           the female, as God had commanded Noah.

01:007:010 And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the
           flood were upon the earth.

01:007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,
           the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the
           fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of
           heaven were opened.

01:007:012 And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.

01:007:013 In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and
           Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three
           wives of his sons with them, into the ark;

01:007:014 They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after
           their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the
           earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every
           bird of every sort.

01:007:015 And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all
           flesh, wherein is the breath of life.

01:007:016 And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,
           as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.

01:007:017 And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters
           increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the
           earth.

01:007:018 And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the
           earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.

01:007:019 And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all
           the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were
           covered.

01:007:020 Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the
           mountains were covered.

01:007:021 And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,
           and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that
           creepeth upon the earth, and every man:

01:007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was
           in the dry land, died.

01:007:023 And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the
           face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping
           things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed
           from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that
           were with him in the ark.

01:007:024 And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty
           days.

01:008:001 And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the
           cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to
           pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;

01:008:002 The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were
           stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;

01:008:003 And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and
           after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were
           abated.

01:008:004 And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth
           day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.

01:008:005 And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in
           the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops
           of the mountains seen.

01:008:006 And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened
           the window of the ark which he had made:

01:008:007 And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until
           the waters were dried up from off the earth.

01:008:008 Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were
           abated from off the face of the ground;

01:008:009 But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she
           returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the
           face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took
           her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.

01:008:010 And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth
           the dove out of the ark;

01:008:011 And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her
           mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the
           waters were abated from off the earth.

01:008:012 And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;
           which returned not again unto him any more.

01:008:013 And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in
           the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were
           dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of
           the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was
           dry.

01:008:014 And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the
           month, was the earth dried.

01:008:015 And God spake unto Noah, saying,

01:008:016 Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy
           sons' wives with thee.

01:008:017 Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of
           all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping
           thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed
           abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon
           the earth.

01:008:018 And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'
           wives with him:

01:008:019 Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and
           whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went
           forth out of the ark.

01:008:020 And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every
           clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt
           offerings on the altar.

01:008:021 And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his
           heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's
           sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his
           youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,
           as I have done.

01:008:022 While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and
           heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not
           cease.

01:009:001 And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be
           fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

01:009:002 And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every
           beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all
           that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the
           sea; into your hand are they delivered.

01:009:003 Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as
           the green herb have I given you all things.

01:009:004 But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,
           shall ye not eat.

01:009:005 And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the
           hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man;
           at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of
           man.

01:009:006 Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:
           for in the image of God made he man.

01:009:007 And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly
           in the earth, and multiply therein.

01:009:008 And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

01:009:009 And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your
           seed after you;

01:009:010 And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl,
           of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from
           all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

01:009:011 And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all
           flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither
           shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

01:009:012 And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make
           between me and you and every living creature that is with you,
           for perpetual generations:

01:009:013 I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a
           covenant between me and the earth.

01:009:014 And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the
           earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:

01:009:015 And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you
           and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall
           no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

01:009:016 And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,
           that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and
           every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.

01:009:017 And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,
           which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon
           the earth.

01:009:018 And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,
           and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.

01:009:019 These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole
           earth overspread.

01:009:020 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:

01:009:021 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was
           uncovered within his tent.

01:009:022 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his
           father, and told his two brethren without.

01:009:023 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both
           their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness
           of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw
           not their father's nakedness.

01:009:024 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son
           had done unto him.

01:009:025 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he
           be unto his brethren.

01:009:026 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall
           be his servant.

01:009:027 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of
           Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.

01:009:028 And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.

01:009:029 And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:
           and he died.

01:010:001 Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,
           and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.

01:010:002 The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,
           and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.

01:010:003 And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.

01:010:004 And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and
           Dodanim.

01:010:005 By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their
           lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in
           their nations.

01:010:006 And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.

01:010:007 And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and
           Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and
           Dedan.

01:010:008 And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the
           earth.

01:010:009 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,
           Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.

01:010:010 And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and
           Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.

01:010:011 Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and
           the city Rehoboth, and Calah,

01:010:012 And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.

01:010:013 And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and
           Naphtuhim,

01:010:014 And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and
           Caphtorim.

01:010:015 And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,

01:010:016 And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,

01:010:017 And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,

01:010:018 And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and
           afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.

01:010:019 And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou
           comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and
           Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.

01:010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their
           tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.

01:010:021 Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the
           brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.

01:010:022 The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,
           and Aram.

01:010:023 And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.

01:010:024 And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.

01:010:025 And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg;
           for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name
           was Joktan.

01:010:026 And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and
           Jerah,

01:010:027 And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,

01:010:028 And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,

01:010:029 And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of
           Joktan.

01:010:030 And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a
           mount of the east.

01:010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their
           tongues, in their lands, after their nations.

01:010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their
           generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations
           divided in the earth after the flood.

01:011:001 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

01:011:002 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that
           they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
           there.

01:011:003 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and
           burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime
           had they for morter.

01:011:004 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,
           whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,
           lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

01:011:005 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which
           the children of men builded.

01:011:006 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have
           all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing
           will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

01:011:007 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
           they may not understand one another's speech.

01:011:008 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
           all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

01:011:009 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
           there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence
           did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
           earth.

01:011:010 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
           old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

01:011:011 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters.

01:011:012 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

01:011:013 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:014 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

01:011:015 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:016 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

01:011:017 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:018 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

01:011:019 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,
           and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:020 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

01:011:021 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:022 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

01:011:023 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and
           begat sons and daughters.

01:011:024 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

01:011:025 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
           years, and begat sons and daughters.

01:011:026 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
           Haran.

01:011:027 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
           Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

01:011:028 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
           nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

01:011:029 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife
           was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter
           of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

01:011:030 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

01:011:031 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
           son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's
           wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,
           to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and
           dwelt there.

01:011:032 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
           Terah died in Haran.

01:012:001 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
           and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land
           that I will shew thee:

01:012:002 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
           and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:

01:012:003 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that
           curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be
           blessed.

01:012:004 So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot
           went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when
           he departed out of Haran.

01:012:005 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and
           all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that
           they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the
           land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.

01:012:006 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,
           unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the
           land.

01:012:007 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will
           I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,
           who appeared unto him.

01:012:008 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of
           Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and
           Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,
           and called upon the name of the LORD.

01:012:009 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.

01:012:010 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
           Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the
           land.

01:012:011 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into
           Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know
           that thou art a fair woman to look upon:

01:012:012 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see
           thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will
           kill me, but they will save thee alive.

01:012:013 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
           me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.

01:012:014 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
           Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.

01:012:015 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
           Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

01:012:016 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,
           and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and
           she asses, and camels.

01:012:017 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
           because of Sarai Abram's wife.

01:012:018 And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast
           done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy
           wife?

01:012:019 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her
           to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go
           thy way.

01:012:020 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent
           him away, and his wife, and all that he had.

01:013:001 And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that
           he had, and Lot with him, into the south.

01:013:002 And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.

01:013:003 And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,
           unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,
           between Bethel and Hai;

01:013:004 Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the
           first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.

01:013:005 And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,
           and tents.

01:013:006 And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell
           together: for their substance was great, so that they could
           not dwell together.

01:013:007 And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle
           and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the
           Perizzite dwelled then in the land.

01:013:008 And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,
           between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;
           for we be brethren.

01:013:009 Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray
           thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go
           to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will
           go to the left.

01:013:010 And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of
           Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD
           destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD,
           like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.

01:013:011 Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed
           east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.

01:013:012 Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the
           cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.

01:013:013 But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD
           exceedingly.

01:013:014 And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated
           from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place
           where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and
           westward:

01:013:015 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and
           to thy seed for ever.

01:013:016 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if
           a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed
           also be numbered.

01:013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the
           breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.

01:013:018 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain
           of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto
           the LORD.

01:014:001 And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,
           Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal
           king of nations;

01:014:002 That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha
           king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of
           Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.

01:014:003 All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is
           the salt sea.

01:014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth
           year they rebelled.

01:014:005 And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings
           that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth
           Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh
           Kiriathaim,

01:014:006 And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by
           the wilderness.

01:014:007 And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and
           smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the
           Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.

01:014:008 And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of
           Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and
           the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle
           with them in the vale of Siddim;

01:014:009 With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of
           nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of
           Ellasar; four kings with five.

01:014:010 And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of
           Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that
           remained fled to the mountain.

01:014:011 And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all
           their victuals, and went their way.

01:014:012 And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,
           and his goods, and departed.

01:014:013 And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the
           Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite,
           brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were
           confederate with Abram.

01:014:014 And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he
           armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three
           hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.

01:014:015 And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by
           night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is
           on the left hand of Damascus.

01:014:016 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his
           brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the
           people.

01:014:017 And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return
           from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were
           with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.

01:014:018 And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:
           and he was the priest of the most high God.

01:014:019 And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most
           high God, possessor of heaven and earth:

01:014:020 And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine
           enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

01:014:021 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,
           and take the goods to thyself.

01:014:022 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand
           unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and
           earth,

01:014:023 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and
           that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou
           shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:

01:014:024 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion
           of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let
           them take their portion.

01:015:001 After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a
           vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy
           exceeding great reward.

01:015:002 And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go
           childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of
           Damascus?

01:015:003 And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,
           lo, one born in my house is mine heir.

01:015:004 And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This
           shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of
           thine own bowels shall be thine heir.

01:015:005 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward
           heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them:
           and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.

01:015:006 And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for
           righteousness.

01:015:007 And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of
           Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.

01:015:008 And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall
           inherit it?

01:015:009 And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,
           and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years
           old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.

01:015:010 And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,
           and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided
           he not.

01:015:011 And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove
           them away.

01:015:012 And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;
           and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.

01:015:013 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall
           be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve
           them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;

01:015:014 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and
           afterward shall they come out with great substance.

01:015:015 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be
           buried in a good old age.

01:015:016 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for
           the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.

01:015:017 And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was
           dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed
           between those pieces.

01:015:018 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,
           Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt
           unto the great river, the river Euphrates:

01:015:019 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,

01:015:020 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,

01:015:021 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and
           the Jebusites.

01:016:001 Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an
           handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

01:016:002 And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath
           restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;
           it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram
           hearkened to the voice of Sarai.

01:016:003 And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after
           Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her
           to her husband Abram to be his wife.

01:016:004 And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw
           that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

01:016:005 And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given
           my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had
           conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between
           me and thee.

01:016:006 But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;
           do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly
           with her, she fled from her face.

01:016:007 And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in
           the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

01:016:008 And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and
           whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my
           mistress Sarai.

01:016:009 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy
           mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.

01:016:010 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy
           seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.

01:016:011 And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with
           child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael;
           because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.

01:016:012 And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,
           and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the
           presence of all his brethren.

01:016:013 And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou
           God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him
           that seeth me?

01:016:014 Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is
           between Kadesh and Bered.

01:016:015 And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,
           which Hagar bare, Ishmael.

01:016:016 And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare
           Ishmael to Abram.

01:017:001 And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD
           appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God;
           walk before me, and be thou perfect.

01:017:002 And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will
           multiply thee exceedingly.

01:017:003 And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

01:017:004 As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be
           a father of many nations.

01:017:005 Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name
           shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made
           thee.

01:017:006 And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make
           nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

01:017:007 And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy
           seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting
           covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

01:017:008 And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the
           land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for
           an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

01:017:009 And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant
           therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

01:017:010 This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you
           and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be
           circumcised.

01:017:011 And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it
           shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

01:017:012 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,
           every man child in your generations, he that is born in the
           house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of
           thy seed.

01:017:013 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy
           money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in
           your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

01:017:014 And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is
           not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people;
           he hath broken my covenant.

01:017:015 And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt
           not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

01:017:016 And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I
           will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of
           people shall be of her.

01:017:017 Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his
           heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years
           old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

01:017:018 And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before
           thee!

01:017:019 And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and
           thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my
           covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his
           seed after him.

01:017:020 And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed
           him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him
           exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make
           him a great nation.

01:017:021 But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall
           bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

01:017:022 And he left off talking with him, and God went up from
           Abraham.

01:017:023 And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in
           his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male
           among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of
           their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.

01:017:024 And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was
           circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

01:017:025 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was
           circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.

01:017:026 In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his
           son.

01:017:027 And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought
           with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.

01:018:001 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he
           sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;

01:018:002 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood
           by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the
           tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,

01:018:003 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight,
           pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:

01:018:004 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your
           feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:

01:018:005 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your
           hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come
           to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.

01:018:006 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
           ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make
           cakes upon the hearth.

01:018:007 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
           good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.

01:018:008 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had
           dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under
           the tree, and they did eat.

01:018:009 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
           Behold, in the tent.

01:018:010 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to
           the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
           And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.

01:018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and
           it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

01:018:012 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am
           waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?

01:018:013 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
           saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?

01:018:014 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I
           will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and
           Sarah shall have a son.

01:018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
           And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.

01:018:016 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
           Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.

01:018:017 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which
           I do;

01:018:018 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
           nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in
           him?

01:018:019 For I know him, that he will command his children and his
           household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,
           to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon
           Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.

01:018:020 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
           great, and because their sin is very grievous;

01:018:021 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
           according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,
           I will know.

01:018:022 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
           Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.

01:018:023 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
           righteous with the wicked?

01:018:024 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
           thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty
           righteous that are therein?

01:018:025 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
           righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as
           the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all
           the earth do right?

01:018:026 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within
           the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.

01:018:027 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon
           me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:

01:018:028 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:
           wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,
           If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.

01:018:029 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
           shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for
           forty's sake.

01:018:030 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
           speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he
           said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.

01:018:031 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto
           the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And
           he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.

01:018:032 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak
           yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And
           he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.

01:018:033 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing
           with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.

01:019:001 And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the
           gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and
           he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;

01:019:002 And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into
           your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,
           and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they
           said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.

01:019:003 And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,
           and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did
           bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.

01:019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of
           Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the
           people from every quarter:

01:019:005 And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men
           which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that
           we may know them.

01:019:006 And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door
           after him,

01:019:007 And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.

01:019:008 Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let
           me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as
           is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for
           therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.

01:019:009 And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one
           fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now
           will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed
           sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.

01:019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the
           house to them, and shut to the door.

01:019:011 And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with
           blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied
           themselves to find the door.

01:019:012 And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in
           law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast
           in the city, bring them out of this place:

01:019:013 For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is
           waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath
           sent us to destroy it.

01:019:014 And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which
           married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this
           place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as
           one that mocked unto his sons in law.

01:019:015 And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,
           saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are
           here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.

01:019:016 And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and
           upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two
           daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought
           him forth, and set him without the city.

01:019:017 And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,
           that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,
           neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,
           lest thou be consumed.

01:019:018 And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:

01:019:019 Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and
           thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me
           in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest
           some evil take me, and I die:

01:019:020 Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little
           one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and
           my soul shall live.

01:019:021 And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning
           this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the
           which thou hast spoken.

01:019:022 Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou
           be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called
           Zoar.

01:019:023 The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.

01:019:024 Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone
           and fire from the LORD out of heaven;

01:019:025 And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the
           inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the
           ground.

01:019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a
           pillar of salt.

01:019:027 And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he
           stood before the LORD:

01:019:028 And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the
           land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the
           country went up as the smoke of a furnace.

01:019:029 And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the
           plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the
           midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the
           which Lot dwelt.

01:019:030 And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and
           his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:
           and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.

01:019:031 And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,
           and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after
           the manner of all the earth:

01:019:032 Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with
           him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

01:019:033 And they made their father drink wine that night: and the
           firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived
           not when she lay down, nor when she arose.

01:019:034 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said
           unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:
           let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,
           and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.

01:019:035 And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the
           younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she
           lay down, nor when she arose.

01:019:036 Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their
           father.

01:019:037 And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the
           same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.

01:019:038 And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name
           Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto
           this day.

01:020:001 And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,
           and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.

01:020:002 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and
           Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

01:020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to
           him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou
           hast taken; for she is a man's wife.

01:020:004 But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt
           thou slay also a righteous nation?

01:020:005 Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she
           herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart
           and innocency of my hands have I done this.

01:020:006 And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst
           this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee
           from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to
           touch her.

01:020:007 Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,
           and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou
           restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,
           and all that are thine.

01:020:008 Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all
           his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the
           men were sore afraid.

01:020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast
           thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou
           hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast
           done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.

01:020:010 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou
           hast done this thing?

01:020:011 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is
           not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.

01:020:012 And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my
           father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my
           wife.

01:020:013 And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my
           father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness
           which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall
           come, say of me, He is my brother.

01:020:014 And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
           womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him
           Sarah his wife.

01:020:015 And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell
           where it pleaseth thee.

01:020:016 And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a
           thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of
           the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:
           thus she was reproved.

01:020:017 So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his
           wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.

01:020:018 For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of
           Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.

01:021:001 And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did
           unto Sarah as he had spoken.

01:021:002 For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at
           the set time of which God had spoken to him.

01:021:003 And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,
           whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.

01:021:004 And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as
           God had commanded him.

01:021:005 And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was
           born unto him.

01:021:006 And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that
           hear will laugh with me.

01:021:007 And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah
           should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in
           his old age.

01:021:008 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great
           feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.

01:021:009 And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had
           born unto Abraham, mocking.

01:021:010 Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and
           her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with
           my son, even with Isaac.

01:021:011 And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of
           his son.

01:021:012 And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight
           because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that
           Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in
           Isaac shall thy seed be called.

01:021:013 And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,
           because he is thy seed.

01:021:014 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and
           a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her
           shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,
           and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

01:021:015 And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child
           under one of the shrubs.

01:021:016 And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way
           off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the
           death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up
           her voice, and wept.

01:021:017 And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God
           called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth
           thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad
           where he is.

01:021:018 Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will
           make him a great nation.

01:021:019 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she
           went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad
           drink.

01:021:020 And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the
           wilderness, and became an archer.

01:021:021 And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took
           him a wife out of the land of Egypt.

01:021:022 And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol
           the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God
           is with thee in all that thou doest:

01:021:023 Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not
           deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:
           but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou
           shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.

01:021:024 And Abraham said, I will swear.

01:021:025 And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,
           which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

01:021:026 And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;
           neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to
           day.

01:021:027 And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;
           and both of them made a covenant.

01:021:028 And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

01:021:029 And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe
           lambs which thou hast set by themselves?

01:021:030 And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my
           hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged
           this well.

01:021:031 Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they
           sware both of them.

01:021:032 Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose
           up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they
           returned into the land of the Philistines.

01:021:033 And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on
           the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.

01:021:034 And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.

01:022:001 And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt
           Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here
           I am.

01:022:002 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou
           lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him
           there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I
           will tell thee of.

01:022:003 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,
           and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and
           clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went
           unto the place of which God had told him.

01:022:004 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the
           place afar off.

01:022:005 And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the
           ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come
           again to you.

01:022:006 And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it
           upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a
           knife; and they went both of them together.

01:022:007 And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:
           and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire
           and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?

01:022:008 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for
           a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.

01:022:009 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and
           Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and
           bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.

01:022:010 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to
           slay his son.

01:022:011 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and
           said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.

01:022:012 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou
           any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,
           seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.

01:022:013 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind
           him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went
           and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in
           the stead of his son.

01:022:014 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it
           is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be
           seen.

01:022:015 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven
           the second time,

01:022:016 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because
           thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,
           thine only son:

01:022:017 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will
           multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
           which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the
           gate of his enemies;

01:022:018 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
           because thou hast obeyed my voice.

01:022:019 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and
           went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.

01:022:020 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told
           Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children
           unto thy brother Nahor;

01:022:021 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father
           of Aram,

01:022:022 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.

01:022:023 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to
           Nahor, Abraham's brother.

01:022:024 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,
           and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.

01:023:001 And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these
           were the years of the life of Sarah.

01:023:002 And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land
           of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep
           for her.

01:023:003 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the
           sons of Heth, saying,

01:023:004 I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession
           of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my
           sight.

01:023:005 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,

01:023:006 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the
           choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall
           withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury
           thy dead.

01:023:007 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the
           land, even to the children of Heth.

01:023:008 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I
           should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for
           me to Ephron the son of Zohar,

01:023:009 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,
           which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is
           worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace
           amongst you.

01:023:010 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the
           Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of
           Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city,
           saying,

01:023:011 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave
           that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons
           of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.

01:023:012 And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.

01:023:013 And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the
           land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me:
           I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I
           will bury my dead there.

01:023:014 And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,

01:023:015 My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred
           shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury
           therefore thy dead.

01:023:016 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to
           Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the
           sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money
           with the merchant.

01:023:017 And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was
           before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and
           all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the
           borders round about, were made sure

01:023:018 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children
           of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.

01:023:019 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of
           the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the
           land of Canaan.

01:023:020 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure
           unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of
           Heth.

01:024:001 And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD
           had blessed Abraham in all things.

01:024:002 And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that
           ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under
           my thigh:

01:024:003 And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and
           the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my
           son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:

01:024:004 But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take
           a wife unto my son Isaac.

01:024:005 And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not
           be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy
           son again unto the land from whence thou camest?

01:024:006 And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my
           son thither again.

01:024:007 The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,
           and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and
           that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this
           land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take
           a wife unto my son from thence.

01:024:008 And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou
           shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son
           thither again.

01:024:009 And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his
           master, and sware to him concerning that matter.

01:024:010 And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,
           and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his
           hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of
           Nahor.

01:024:011 And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a
           well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that
           women go out to draw water.

01:024:012 And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send
           me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master
           Abraham.

01:024:013 Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters
           of the men of the city come out to draw water:

01:024:014 And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,
           Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she
           shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let
           the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant
           Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness
           unto my master.

01:024:015 And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,
           behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of
           Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher
           upon her shoulder.

01:024:016 And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither
           had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and
           filled her pitcher, and came up.

01:024:017 And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray
           thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.

01:024:018 And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her
           pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.

01:024:019 And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw
           water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.

01:024:020 And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and
           ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his
           camels.

01:024:021 And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether
           the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.

01:024:022 And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the
           man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two
           bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;

01:024:023 And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is
           there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?

01:024:024 And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of
           Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.

01:024:025 She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender
           enough, and room to lodge in.

01:024:026 And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.

01:024:027 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who
           hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:
           I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my
           master's brethren.

01:024:028 And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these
           things.

01:024:029 And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban
           ran out unto the man, unto the well.

01:024:030 And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets
           upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of
           Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that
           he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at
           the well.

01:024:031 And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore
           standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room
           for the camels.

01:024:032 And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,
           and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash
           his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.

01:024:033 And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will
           not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.

01:024:034 And he said, I am Abraham's servant.

01:024:035 And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become
           great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver,
           and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and
           asses.

01:024:036 And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she
           was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.

01:024:037 And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a
           wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose
           land I dwell:

01:024:038 But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,
           and take a wife unto my son.

01:024:039 And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not
           follow me.

01:024:040 And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send
           his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take
           a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:

01:024:041 Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest
           to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be
           clear from my oath.

01:024:042 And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my
           master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:

01:024:043 Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to
           pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I
           say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy
           pitcher to drink;

01:024:044 And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for
           thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath
           appointed out for my master's son.

01:024:045 And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah
           came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down
           unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me
           drink, I pray thee.

01:024:046 And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her
           shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink
           also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

01:024:047 And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she
           said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare
           unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the
           bracelets upon her hands.

01:024:048 And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed
           the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the
           right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.

01:024:049 And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell
           me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or
           to the left.

01:024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth
           from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.

01:024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her
           be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.

01:024:052 And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their
           words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.

01:024:053 And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of
           gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to
           her brother and to her mother precious things.

01:024:054 And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,
           and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he
           said, Send me away unto my master.

01:024:055 And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with
           us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.

01:024:056 And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath
           prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.

01:024:057 And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her
           mouth.

01:024:058 And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with
           this man? And she said, I will go.

01:024:059 And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and
           Abraham's servant, and his men.

01:024:060 And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our
           sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let
           thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.

01:024:061 And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the
           camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah,
           and went his way.

01:024:062 And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt
           in the south country.

01:024:063 And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:
           and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels
           were coming.

01:024:064 And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she
           lighted off the camel.

01:024:065 For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that
           walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It
           is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.

01:024:066 And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.

01:024:067 And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took
           Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac
           was comforted after his mother's death.

01:025:001 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.

01:025:002 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,
           and Ishbak, and Shuah.

01:025:003 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
           Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.

01:025:004 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and
           Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.

01:025:005 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.

01:025:006 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had,
           Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son,
           while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.

01:025:007 And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he
           lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.

01:025:008 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
           old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.

01:025:009 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
           Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the
           Hittite, which is before Mamre;

01:025:010 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there
           was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.

01:025:011 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God
           blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.

01:025:012 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom
           Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:

01:025:013 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their
           names, according to their generations: the firstborn of
           Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,

01:025:014 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,

01:025:015 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:

01:025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by
           their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to
           their nations.

01:025:017 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
           thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and
           was gathered unto his people.

01:025:018 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt,
           as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of
           all his brethren.

01:025:019 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham
           begat Isaac:

01:025:020 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,
           the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to
           Laban the Syrian.

01:025:021 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was
           barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his
           wife conceived.

01:025:022 And the children struggled together within her; and she said,
           If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the
           LORD.

01:025:023 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and
           two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and
           the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and
           the elder shall serve the younger.

01:025:024 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,
           there were twins in her womb.

01:025:025 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;
           and they called his name Esau.

01:025:026 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
           Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was
           threescore years old when she bare them.

01:025:027 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
           field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.

01:025:028 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but
           Rebekah loved Jacob.

01:025:029 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he
           was faint:

01:025:030 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same
           red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called
           Edom.

01:025:031 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.

01:025:032 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what
           profit shall this birthright do to me?

01:025:033 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:
           and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.

01:025:034 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
           eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau
           despised his birthright.

01:026:001 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine
           that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech
           king of the Philistines unto Gerar.

01:026:002 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into
           Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:

01:026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless
           thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these
           countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto
           Abraham thy father;

01:026:004 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,
           and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy
           seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;

01:026:005 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
           commandments, my statutes, and my laws.

01:026:006 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:

01:026:007 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said,
           She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest,
           said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;
           because she was fair to look upon.

01:026:008 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
           Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and
           saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.

01:026:009 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she
           is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac
           said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.

01:026:010 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one
           of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou
           shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.

01:026:011 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth
           this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.

01:026:012 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year
           an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.

01:026:013 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
           became very great:

01:026:014 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and
           great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.

01:026:015 For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in
           the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped
           them, and filled them with earth.

01:026:016 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
           mightier than we.

01:026:017 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley
           of Gerar, and dwelt there.

01:026:018 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had
           digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines
           had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called
           their names after the names by which his father had called
           them.

01:026:019 And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a
           well of springing water.

01:026:020 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,
           saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well
           Esek; because they strove with him.

01:026:021 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
           called the name of it Sitnah.

01:026:022 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
           that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;
           and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we
           shall be fruitful in the land.

01:026:023 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.

01:026:024 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
           the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,
           and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant
           Abraham's sake.

01:026:025 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
           LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants
           digged a well.

01:026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
           friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.

01:026:027 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
           hate me, and have sent me away from you?

01:026:028 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:
           and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt
           us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;

01:026:029 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and
           as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee
           away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.

01:026:030 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.

01:026:031 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
           another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him
           in peace.

01:026:032 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,
           and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and
           said unto him, We have found water.

01:026:033 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is
           Beersheba unto this day.

01:026:034 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
           daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of
           Elon the Hittite:

01:026:035 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.

01:027:001 And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes
           were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest
           son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,
           here am I.

01:027:002 And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my
           death:

01:027:003 Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and
           thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;

01:027:004 And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,
           that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.

01:027:005 And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau
           went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

01:027:006 And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard
           thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,

01:027:007 Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,
           and bless thee before the LORD before my death.

01:027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I
           command thee.

01:027:009 Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of
           the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,
           such as he loveth:

01:027:010 And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and
           that he may bless thee before his death.

01:027:011 And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother
           is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:

01:027:012 My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him
           as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a
           blessing.

01:027:013 And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:
           only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.

01:027:014 And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and
           his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.

01:027:015 And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which
           were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her
           younger son:

01:027:016 And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,
           and upon the smooth of his neck:

01:027:017 And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had
           prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.

01:027:018 And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,
           Here am I; who art thou, my son?

01:027:019 And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I
           have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit
           and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.

01:027:020 And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it
           so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God
           brought it to me.

01:027:021 And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may
           feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.

01:027:022 And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,
           and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the
           hands of Esau.

01:027:023 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his
           brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.

01:027:024 And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.

01:027:025 And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's
           venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near
           to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.

01:027:026 And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss
           me, my son.

01:027:027 And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of
           his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my
           son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:

01:027:028 Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness
           of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:

01:027:029 Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord
           over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:
           cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that
           blesseth thee.

01:027:030 And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of
           blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the
           presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in
           from his hunting.

01:027:031 And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his
           father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat
           of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.

01:027:032 And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,
           I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.

01:027:033 And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is
           he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have
           eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,
           and he shall be blessed.

01:027:034 And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a
           great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father,
           Bless me, even me also, O my father.

01:027:035 And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken
           away thy blessing.

01:027:036 And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath
           supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright;
           and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said,
           Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?

01:027:037 And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him
           thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for
           servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and
           what shall I do now unto thee, my son?

01:027:038 And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my
           father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted
           up his voice, and wept.

01:027:039 And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy
           dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of
           heaven from above;

01:027:040 And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;
           and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,
           that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.

01:027:041 And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his
           father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of
           mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my
           brother Jacob.

01:027:042 And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:
           and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto
           him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort
           himself, purposing to kill thee.

01:027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to
           Laban my brother to Haran;

01:027:044 And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn
           away;

01:027:045 Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget
           that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch
           thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in
           one day?

01:027:046 And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of
           the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters
           of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,
           what good shall my life do me?

01:028:001 And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and
           said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of
           Canaan.

01:028:002 Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's
           father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of
           Laban thy mother's brother.

01:028:003 And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and
           multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;

01:028:004 And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy
           seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou
           art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.

01:028:005 And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto
           Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,
           Jacob's and Esau's mother.

01:028:006 When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away
           to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he
           blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take
           a wife of the daughers of Canaan;

01:028:007 And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone
           to Padanaram;

01:028:008 And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac
           his father;

01:028:009 Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he
           had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister
           of Nebajoth, to be his wife.

01:028:010 And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

01:028:011 And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all
           night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of
           that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that
           place to sleep.

01:028:012 And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and
           the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God
           ascending and descending on it.

01:028:013 And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD
           God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land
           whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;

01:028:014 And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt
           spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,
           and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the
           families of the earth be blessed.

01:028:015 And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places
           whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land;
           for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have
           spoken to thee of.

01:028:016 And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the
           LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.

01:028:017 And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this
           is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of
           heaven.

01:028:018 And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone
           that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,
           and poured oil upon the top of it.

01:028:019 And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of
           that city was called Luz at the first.

01:028:020 And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and
           will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to
           eat, and raiment to put on,

01:028:021 So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall
           the LORD be my God:

01:028:022 And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's
           house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give
           the tenth unto thee.

01:029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
           people of the east.

01:029:002 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
           were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well
           they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's
           mouth.

01:029:003 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
           stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put
           the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.

01:029:004 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they
           said, Of Haran are we.

01:029:005 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And
           they said, We know him.

01:029:006 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
           and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.

01:029:007 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that
           the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,
           and go and feed them.

01:029:008 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
           together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth;
           then we water the sheep.

01:029:009 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her
           father's sheep; for she kept them.

01:029:010 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of
           Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his
           mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone
           from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his
           mother's brother.

01:029:011 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

01:029:012 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and
           that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.

01:029:013 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
           sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and
           kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban
           all these things.

01:029:014 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.
           And he abode with him the space of a month.

01:029:015 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
           shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what
           shall thy wages be?

01:029:016 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,
           and the name of the younger was Rachel.

01:029:017 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
           favoured.

01:029:018 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven
           years for Rachel thy younger daughter.

01:029:019 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than
           that I should give her to another man: abide with me.

01:029:020 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
           him but a few days, for the love he had to her.

01:029:021 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
           fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.

01:029:022 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made
           a feast.

01:029:023 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
           daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.

01:029:024 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
           handmaid.

01:029:025 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:
           and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did
           not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou
           beguiled me?

01:029:026 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
           the younger before the firstborn.

01:029:027 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the
           service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.

01:029:028 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him
           Rachel his daughter to wife also.

01:029:029 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to
           be her maid.

01:029:030 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
           than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.

01:029:031 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:
           but Rachel was barren.

01:029:032 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
           Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my
           affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.

01:029:033 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
           LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this
           son also: and she called his name Simeon.

01:029:034 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this
           time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born
           him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.

01:029:035 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now
           will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah;
           and left bearing.

01:030:001 And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel
           envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or
           else I die.

01:030:002 And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am
           I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the
           womb?

01:030:003 And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she
           shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by
           her.

01:030:004 And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went
           in unto her.

01:030:005 And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.

01:030:006 And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my
           voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name
           Dan.

01:030:007 And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a
           second son.

01:030:008 And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my
           sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name
           Naphtali.

01:030:009 When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her
           maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.

01:030:010 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.

01:030:011 And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.

01:030:012 And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.

01:030:013 And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me
           blessed: and she called his name Asher.

01:030:014 And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found
           mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.
           Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's
           mandrakes.

01:030:015 And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast
           taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's
           mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with
           thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.

01:030:016 And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went
           out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for
           surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay
           with her that night.

01:030:017 And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob
           the fifth son.

01:030:018 And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given
           my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.

01:030:019 And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.

01:030:020 And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will
           my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:
           and she called his name Zebulun.

01:030:021 And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.

01:030:022 And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and
           opened her womb.

01:030:023 And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken
           away my reproach:

01:030:024 And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add
           to me another son.

01:030:025 And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob
           said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own
           place, and to my country.

01:030:026 Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,
           and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done
           thee.

01:030:027 And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour
           in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that
           the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.

01:030:028 And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.

01:030:029 And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and
           how thy cattle was with me.

01:030:030 For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is
           now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee
           since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own
           house also?

01:030:031 And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou
           shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for
           me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.

01:030:032 I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence
           all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle
           among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:
           and of such shall be my hire.

01:030:033 So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when
           it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is
           not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the
           sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.

01:030:034 And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy
           word.

01:030:035 And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and
           spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,
           and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown
           among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

01:030:036 And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and
           Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

01:030:037 And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and
           chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the
           white appear which was in the rods.

01:030:038 And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in
           the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to
           drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.

01:030:039 And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth
           cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.

01:030:040 And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the
           flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock
           of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put
           them not unto Laban's cattle.

01:030:041 And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did
           conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the
           cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the
           rods.

01:030:042 But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the
           feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

01:030:043 And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and
           maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

01:031:001 And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath
           taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was
           our father's hath he gotten all this glory.

01:031:002 And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was
           not toward him as before.

01:031:003 And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy
           fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.

01:031:004 And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto
           his flock,

01:031:005 And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it
           is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been
           with me.

01:031:006 And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.

01:031:007 And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten
           times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.

01:031:008 If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the
           cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked
           shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.

01:031:009 Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given
           them to me.

01:031:010 And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,
           that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,
           the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,
           speckled, and grisled.

01:031:011 And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:
           And I said, Here am I.

01:031:012 And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams
           which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and
           grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.

01:031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and
           where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from
           this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.

01:031:014 And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet
           any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?

01:031:015 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and
           hath quite devoured also our money.

01:031:016 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that
           is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath
           said unto thee, do.

01:031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon
           camels;

01:031:018 And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he
           had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in
           Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of
           Canaan.

01:031:019 And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the
           images that were her father's.

01:031:020 And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he
           told him not that he fled.

01:031:021 So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed
           over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.

01:031:022 And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.

01:031:023 And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven
           days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.

01:031:024 And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said
           unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good
           or bad.

01:031:025 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in
           the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of
           Gilead.

01:031:026 And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast
           stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as
           captives taken with the sword?

01:031:027 Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from
           me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away
           with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?

01:031:028 And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?
           thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.

01:031:029 It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of
           your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed
           that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.

01:031:030 And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore
           longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou
           stolen my gods?

01:031:031 And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:
           for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy
           daughters from me.

01:031:032 With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:
           before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and
           take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen
           them.

01:031:033 And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and
           into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then
           went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

01:031:034 Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's
           furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,
           but found them not.

01:031:035 And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that
           I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon
           me. And he searched but found not the images.

01:031:036 And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered
           and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that
           thou hast so hotly pursued after me?

01:031:037 Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found
           of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and
           thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.

01:031:038 This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she
           goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock
           have I not eaten.

01:031:039 That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare
           the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether
           stolen by day, or stolen by night.

01:031:040 Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost
           by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.

01:031:041 Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee
           fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy
           cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.

01:031:042 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear
           of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now
           empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my
           hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.

01:031:043 And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my
           daughters, and these children are my children, and these
           cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and
           what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their
           children which they have born?

01:031:044 Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;
           and let it be for a witness between me and thee.

01:031:045 And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

01:031:046 And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took
           stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the
           heap.

01:031:047 And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it
           Galeed.

01:031:048 And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee
           this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;

01:031:049 And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,
           when we are absent one from another.

01:031:050 If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take
           other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God
           is witness betwixt me and thee.

01:031:051 And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this
           pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:

01:031:052 This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will
           not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass
           over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.

01:031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their
           father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his
           father Isaac.

01:031:054 Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his
           brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all
           night in the mount.

01:031:055 And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons
           and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and
           returned unto his place.

01:032:001 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

01:032:002 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he
           called the name of that place Mahanaim.

01:032:003 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto
           the land of Seir, the country of Edom.

01:032:004 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my
           lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with
           Laban, and stayed there until now:

01:032:005 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
           womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may
           find grace in thy sight.

01:032:006 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
           brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four
           hundred men with him.

01:032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided
           the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and
           the camels, into two bands;

01:032:008 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then
           the other company which is left shall escape.

01:032:009 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my
           father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy
           country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:

01:032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all
           the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with
           my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two
           bands.

01:032:011 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
           hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,
           and the mother with the children.

01:032:012 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
           as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for
           multitude.

01:032:013 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which
           came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;

01:032:014 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
           and twenty rams,

01:032:015 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten
           bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.

01:032:016 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every
           drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over
           before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.

01:032:017 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
           meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and
           whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?

01:032:018 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a
           present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind
           us.

01:032:019 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
           followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak
           unto Esau, when ye find him.

01:032:020 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.
           For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth
           before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he
           will accept of me.

01:032:021 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
           night in the company.

01:032:022 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
           womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford
           Jabbok.

01:032:023 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
           that he had.

01:032:024 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
           until the breaking of the day.

01:032:025 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
           the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was
           out of joint, as he wrestled with him.

01:032:026 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
           will not let thee go, except thou bless me.

01:032:027 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.

01:032:028 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but
           Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,
           and hast prevailed.

01:032:029 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
           And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?
           And he blessed him there.

01:032:030 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
           God face to face, and my life is preserved.

01:032:031 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
           halted upon his thigh.

01:032:032 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
           shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:
           because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew
           that shrank.

01:033:001 And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau
           came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the
           children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two
           handmaids.

01:033:002 And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah
           and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.

01:033:003 And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the
           ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

01:033:004 And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his
           neck, and kissed him: and they wept.

01:033:005 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;
           and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children
           which God hath graciously given thy servant.

01:033:006 Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and
           they bowed themselves.

01:033:007 And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed
           themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they
           bowed themselves.

01:033:008 And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?
           And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.

01:033:009 And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast
           unto thyself.

01:033:010 And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in
           thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I
           have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and
           thou wast pleased with me.

01:033:011 Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;
           because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have
           enough. And he urged him, and he took it.

01:033:012 And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I
           will go before thee.

01:033:013 And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are
           tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and
           if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.

01:033:014 Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I
           will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before
           me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my
           lord unto Seir.

01:033:015 And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk
           that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find
           grace in the sight of my lord.

01:033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.

01:033:017 And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and
           made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is
           called Succoth.

01:033:018 And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the
           land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his
           tent before the city.

01:033:019 And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his
           tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,
           for an hundred pieces of money.

01:033:020 And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.

01:034:001 And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,
           went out to see the daughters of the land.

01:034:002 And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the
           country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled
           her.

01:034:003 And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he
           loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.

01:034:004 And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this
           damsel to wife.

01:034:005 And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now
           his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his
           peace until they were come.

01:034:006 And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune
           with him.

01:034:007 And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard
           it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,
           because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's
           daughter: which thing ought not to be done.

01:034:008 And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son
           Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to
           wife.

01:034:009 And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto
           us, and take our daughters unto you.

01:034:010 And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;
           dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.

01:034:011 And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me
           find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will
           give.

01:034:012 Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according
           as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.

01:034:013 And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father
           deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their
           sister:

01:034:014 And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our
           sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach
           unto us:

01:034:015 But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,
           that every male of you be circumcised;

01:034:016 Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take
           your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will
           become one people.

01:034:017 But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then
           will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.

01:034:018 And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.

01:034:019 And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had
           delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than
           all the house of his father.

01:034:020 And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their
           city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,

01:034:021 These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in
           the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large
           enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,
           and let us give them our daughters.

01:034:022 Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,
           to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as
           they are circumcised.

01:034:023 Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of
           their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will
           dwell with us.

01:034:024 And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that
           went out of the gate of his city; and every male was
           circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.

01:034:025 And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,
           that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's
           brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city
           boldly, and slew all the males.

01:034:026 And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the
           sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.

01:034:027 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,
           because they had defiled their sister.

01:034:028 They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and
           that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,

01:034:029 And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their
           wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the
           house.

01:034:030 And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make
           me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the
           Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they
           shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and
           I shall be destroyed, I and my house.

01:034:031 And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an
           harlot?

01:035:001 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell
           there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto
           thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.

01:035:002 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
           him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be
           clean, and change your garments:

01:035:003 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there
           an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress,
           and was with me in the way which I went.

01:035:004 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in
           their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears;
           and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.

01:035:005 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
           that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the
           sons of Jacob.

01:035:006 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
           Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.

01:035:007 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:
           because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the
           face of his brother.

01:035:008 But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath
           Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called
           Allonbachuth.

01:035:009 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of
           Padanaram, and blessed him.

01:035:010 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not
           be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he
           called his name Israel.

01:035:011 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
           multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee,
           and kings shall come out of thy loins;

01:035:012 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will
           give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.

01:035:013 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with
           him.

01:035:014 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with
           him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering
           thereon, and he poured oil thereon.

01:035:015 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with
           him, Bethel.

01:035:016 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way
           to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard
           labour.

01:035:017 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the
           midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son
           also.

01:035:018 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she
           died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called
           him Benjamin.

01:035:019 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which
           is Bethlehem.

01:035:020 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
           Rachel's grave unto this day.

01:035:021 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of
           Edar.

01:035:022 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that
           Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and
           Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:

01:035:023 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and
           Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:

01:035:024 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:

01:035:025 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:

01:035:026 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these
           are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.

01:035:027 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city
           of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.

01:035:028 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.

01:035:029 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto
           his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and
           Jacob buried him.

01:036:001 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.

01:036:002 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the
           daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of
           Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;

01:036:003 And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

01:036:004 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;

01:036:005 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are
           the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of
           Canaan.

01:036:006 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and
           all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his
           beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of
           Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother
           Jacob.

01:036:007 For their riches were more than that they might dwell
           together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not
           bear them because of their cattle.

01:036:008 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.

01:036:009 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the
           Edomites in mount Seir:

01:036:010 These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah
           the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.

01:036:011 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam,
           and Kenaz.

01:036:012 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to
           Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.

01:036:013 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,
           and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.

01:036:014 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah
           the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau
           Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.

01:036:015 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
           firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke
           Kenaz,

01:036:016 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes
           that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons
           of Adah.

01:036:017 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke
           Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that
           came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of
           Bashemath Esau's wife.

01:036:018 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,
           duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of
           Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

01:036:019 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their
           dukes.

01:036:020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
           Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,

01:036:021 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the
           Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

01:036:022 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's
           sister was Timna.

01:036:023 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath,
           and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.

01:036:024 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah:
           this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as
           he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.

01:036:025 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah
           the daughter of Anah.

01:036:026 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
           Ithran, and Cheran.

01:036:027 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.

01:036:028 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.

01:036:029 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
           Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,

01:036:030 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that
           came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.

01:036:031 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,
           before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.

01:036:032 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his
           city was Dinhabah.

01:036:033 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in
           his stead.

01:036:034 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in
           his stead.

01:036:035 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian
           in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of
           his city was Avith.

01:036:036 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.

01:036:037 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in
           his stead.

01:036:038 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his
           stead.

01:036:039 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
           stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name
           was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of
           Mezahab.

01:036:040 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,
           according to their families, after their places, by their
           names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,

01:036:041 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,

01:036:042 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,

01:036:043 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according
           to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is
           Esau the father of the Edomites.

01:037:001 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger,
           in the land of Canaan.

01:037:002 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen
           years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the
           lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah,
           his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their
           evil report.

01:037:003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
           was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many
           colours.

01:037:004 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more
           than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak
           peaceably unto him.

01:037:005 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and
           they hated him yet the more.

01:037:006 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I
           have dreamed:

01:037:007 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my
           sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves
           stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.

01:037:008 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?
           or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him
           yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.

01:037:009 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,
           and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold,
           the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to
           me.

01:037:010 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
           father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that
           thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren
           indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?

01:037:011 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the
           saying.

01:037:012 And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

01:037:013 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the
           flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he
           said to him, Here am I.

01:037:014 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
           with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word
           again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came
           to Shechem.

01:037:015 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
           the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?

01:037:016 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where
           they feed their flocks.

01:037:017 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them
           say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,
           and found them in Dothan.

01:037:018 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
           them, they conspired against him to slay him.

01:037:019 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.

01:037:020 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into
           some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:
           and we shall see what will become of his dreams.

01:037:021 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
           and said, Let us not kill him.

01:037:022 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
           this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;
           that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to
           his father again.

01:037:023 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
           that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many
           colours that was on him;

01:037:024 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was
           empty, there was no water in it.

01:037:025 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
           and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from
           Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,
           going to carry it down to Egypt.

01:037:026 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
           our brother, and conceal his blood?

01:037:027 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our
           hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his
           brethren were content.

01:037:028 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
           lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the
           Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought
           Joseph into Egypt.

01:037:029 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not
           in the pit; and he rent his clothes.

01:037:030 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
           and I, whither shall I go?

01:037:031 And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,
           and dipped the coat in the blood;

01:037:032 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to
           their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether
           it be thy son's coat or no.

01:037:033 And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast
           hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.

01:037:034 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
           and mourned for his son many days.

01:037:035 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
           but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go
           down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept
           for him.

01:037:036 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an
           officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

01:038:001 And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from
           his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose
           name was Hirah.

01:038:002 And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose
           name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.

01:038:003 And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.

01:038:004 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his
           name Onan.

01:038:005 And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his
           name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

01:038:006 And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was
           Tamar.

01:038:007 And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the
           LORD; and the LORD slew him.

01:038:008 And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and
           marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.

01:038:009 And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to
           pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled
           it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his
           brother.

01:038:010 And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he
           slew him also.

01:038:011 Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow
           at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he
           said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And
           Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.

01:038:012 And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife
           died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his
           sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the
           Adullamite.

01:038:013 And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth
           up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

01:038:014 And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her
           with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,
           which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was
           grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.

01:038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because
           she had covered her face.

01:038:016 And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray
           thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was
           his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,
           that thou mayest come in unto me?

01:038:017 And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she
           said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

01:038:018 And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy
           signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine
           hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she
           conceived by him.

01:038:019 And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,
           and put on the garments of her widowhood.

01:038:020 And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the
           Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but
           he found her not.

01:038:021 Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the
           harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There
           was no harlot in this place.

01:038:022 And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and
           also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in
           this place.

01:038:023 And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:
           behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.

01:038:024 And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told
           Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the
           harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And
           Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.

01:038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,
           saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she
           said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and
           bracelets, and staff.

01:038:026 And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more
           righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my
           son. And he knew her again no more.

01:038:027 And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,
           twins were in her womb.

01:038:028 And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out
           his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a
           scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.

01:038:029 And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,
           his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken
           forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called
           Pharez.

01:038:030 And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet
           thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.

01:039:001 And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer
           of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of
           the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down
           thither.

01:039:002 And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and
           he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

01:039:003 And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the
           LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.

01:039:004 And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he
           made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put
           into his hand.

01:039:005 And it came to pass from the time that he had made him
           overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD
           blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the
           blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,
           and in the field.

01:039:006 And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not
           ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was
           a goodly person, and well favoured.

01:039:007 And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife
           cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.

01:039:008 But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my
           master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath
           committed all that he hath to my hand;

01:039:009 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he
           kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his
           wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against
           God?

01:039:010 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that
           he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.

01:039:011 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the
           house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the
           house there within.

01:039:012 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he
           left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.

01:039:013 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment
           in her hand, and was fled forth,

01:039:014 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto
           them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to
           mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a
           loud voice:

01:039:015 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice
           and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got
           him out.

01:039:016 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.

01:039:017 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The
           Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto
           me to mock me:

01:039:018 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that
           he left his garment with me, and fled out.

01:039:019 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his
           wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did
           thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.

01:039:020 And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a
           place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there
           in the prison.

01:039:021 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave
           him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

01:039:022 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all
           the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did
           there, he was the doer of it.

01:039:023 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was
           under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which
           he did, the LORD made it to prosper.

01:040:001 And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the
           king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king
           of Egypt.

01:040:002 And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the
           chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.

01:040:003 And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the
           guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

01:040:004 And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he
           served them: and they continued a season in ward.

01:040:005 And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in
           one night, each man according to the interpretation of his
           dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which
           were bound in the prison.

01:040:006 And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon
           them, and, behold, they were sad.

01:040:007 And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward
           of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to
           day?

01:040:008 And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is
           no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not
           interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.

01:040:009 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to
           him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;

01:040:010 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it
           budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof
           brought forth ripe grapes:

01:040:011 And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and
           pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into
           Pharaoh's hand.

01:040:012 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:
           The three branches are three days:

01:040:013 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and
           restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's
           cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his
           butler.

01:040:014 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew
           kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto
           Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:

01:040:015 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:
           and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into
           the dungeon.

01:040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he
           said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had
           three white baskets on my head:

01:040:017 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of
           bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the
           basket upon my head.

01:040:018 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation
           thereof: The three baskets are three days:

01:040:019 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off
           thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat
           thy flesh from off thee.

01:040:020 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's
           birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he
           lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker
           among his servants.

01:040:021 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;
           and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:

01:040:022 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to
           them.

01:040:023 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.

01:041:001 And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh
           dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.

01:041:002 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well
           favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

01:041:003 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the
           river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other
           kine upon the brink of the river.

01:041:004 And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven
           well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.

01:041:005 And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven
           ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.

01:041:006 And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind
           sprung up after them.

01:041:007 And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.
           And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.

01:041:008 And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was
           troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of
           Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his
           dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto
           Pharaoh.

01:041:009 Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do
           remember my faults this day:

01:041:010 Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the
           captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:

01:041:011 And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each
           man according to the interpretation of his dream.

01:041:012 And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to
           the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted
           to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did
           interpret.

01:041:013 And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he
           restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.

01:041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him
           hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed
           his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.

01:041:015 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and
           there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of
           thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.

01:041:016 And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God
           shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.

01:041:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood
           upon the bank of the river:

01:041:018 And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,
           fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:

01:041:019 And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and
           very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all
           the land of Egypt for badness:

01:041:020 And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first
           seven fat kine:

01:041:021 And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that
           they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at
           the beginning. So I awoke.

01:041:022 And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one
           stalk, full and good:

01:041:023 And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the
           east wind, sprung up after them:

01:041:024 And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told
           this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare
           it to me.

01:041:025 And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God
           hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.

01:041:026 The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears
           are seven years: the dream is one.

01:041:027 And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after
           them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with
           the east wind shall be seven years of famine.

01:041:028 This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God
           is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

01:041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all
           the land of Egypt:

01:041:030 And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and
           all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and
           the famine shall consume the land;

01:041:031 And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of
           that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.

01:041:032 And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is
           because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly
           bring it to pass.

01:041:033 Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,
           and set him over the land of Egypt.

01:041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the
           land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the
           seven plenteous years.

01:041:035 And let them gather all the food of those good years that
           come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them
           keep food in the cities.

01:041:036 And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven
           years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the
           land perish not through the famine.

01:041:037 And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes
           of all his servants.

01:041:038 And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as
           this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?

01:041:039 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed
           thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

01:041:040 Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall
           all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater
           than thou.

01:041:041 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all
           the land of Egypt.

01:041:042 And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon
           Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and
           put a gold chain about his neck;

01:041:043 And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;
           and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler
           over all the land of Egypt.

01:041:044 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee
           shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of
           Egypt.

01:041:045 And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave
           him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.
           And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.

01:041:046 And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh
           king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of
           Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

01:041:047 And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by
           handfuls.

01:041:048 And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were
           in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the
           food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he
           up in the same.

01:041:049 And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,
           until he left numbering; for it was without number.

01:041:050 And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine
           came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
           bare unto him.

01:041:051 And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,
           said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's
           house.

01:041:052 And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath
           caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.

01:041:053 And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of
           Egypt, were ended.

01:041:054 And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as
           Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all
           the land of Egypt there was bread.

01:041:055 And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried
           to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,
           Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.

01:041:056 And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph
           opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and
           the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.

01:041:057 And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;
           because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

01:042:001 Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said
           unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?

01:042:002 And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:
           get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may
           live, and not die.

01:042:003 And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.

01:042:004 But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his
           brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.

01:042:005 And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:
           for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

01:042:006 And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that
           sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren
           came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to
           the earth.

01:042:007 And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made
           himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he
           said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land
           of Canaan to buy food.

01:042:008 And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.

01:042:009 And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and
           said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land
           ye are come.

01:042:010 And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy
           servants come.

01:042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are
           no spies.

01:042:012 And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the
           land ye are come.

01:042:013 And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of
           one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is
           this day with our father, and one is not.

01:042:014 And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,
           saying, Ye are spies:

01:042:015 Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not
           go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.

01:042:016 Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall
           be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether
           there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh
           surely ye are spies.

01:042:017 And he put them all together into ward three days.

01:042:018 And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;
           for I fear God:

01:042:019 If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the
           house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your
           houses:

01:042:020 But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words
           be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.

01:042:021 And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning
           our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he
           besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress
           come upon us.

01:042:022 And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,
           saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?
           therefore, behold, also his blood is required.

01:042:023 And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake
           unto them by an interpreter.

01:042:024 And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned
           to them again, and communed with them, and took from them
           Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.

01:042:025 Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to
           restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them
           provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.

01:042:026 And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.

01:042:027 And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender
           in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his
           sack's mouth.

01:042:028 And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,
           it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they
           were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath
           done unto us?

01:042:029 And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,
           and told him all that befell unto them; saying,

01:042:030 The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and
           took us for spies of the country.

01:042:031 And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:

01:042:032 We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the
           youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.

01:042:033 And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby
           shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren
           here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,
           and be gone:

01:042:034 And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know
           that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I
           deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.

01:042:035 And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,
           every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both
           they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were
           afraid.

01:042:036 And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of
           my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will
           take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.

01:042:037 And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if
           I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will
           bring him to thee again.

01:042:038 And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his
           brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him
           by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my
           gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

01:043:001 And the famine was sore in the land.

01:043:002 And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which
           they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go
           again, buy us a little food.

01:043:003 And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest
           unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother
           be with you.

01:043:004 If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy
           thee food:

01:043:005 But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the
           man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your
           brother be with you.

01:043:006 And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell
           the man whether ye had yet a brother?

01:043:007 And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of
           our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another
           brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these
           words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your
           brother down?

01:043:008 And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,
           and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both
           we, and thou, and also our little ones.

01:043:009 I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:
           if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then
           let me bear the blame for ever:

01:043:010 For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this
           second time.

01:043:011 And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,
           do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,
           and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little
           honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:

01:043:012 And take double money in your hand; and the money that was
           brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in
           your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:

01:043:013 Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:

01:043:014 And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may
           send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved
           of my children, I am bereaved.

01:043:015 And the men took that present, and they took double money in
           their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,
           and stood before Joseph.

01:043:016 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler
           of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;
           for these men shall dine with me at noon.

01:043:017 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men
           into Joseph's house.

01:043:018 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into
           Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was
           returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;
           that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and
           take us for bondmen, and our asses.

01:043:019 And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they
           communed with him at the door of the house,

01:043:020 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy
           food:

01:043:021 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened
           our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of
           his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it
           again in our hand.

01:043:022 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:
           we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.

01:043:023 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God
           of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had
           your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.

01:043:024 And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them
           water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses
           provender.

01:043:025 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:
           for they heard that they should eat bread there.

01:043:026 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which
           was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him
           to the earth.

01:043:027 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father
           well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?

01:043:028 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,
           he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made
           obeisance.

01:043:029 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his
           mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom
           ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my
           son.

01:043:030 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his
           brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his
           chamber, and wept there.

01:043:031 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,
           and said, Set on bread.

01:043:032 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by
           themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by
           themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the
           Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.

01:043:033 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his
           birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the
           men marvelled one at another.

01:043:034 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but
           Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And
           they drank, and were merry with him.

01:044:001 And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the
           men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put
           every man's money in his sack's mouth.

01:044:002 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the
           youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word
           that Joseph had spoken.

01:044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they
           and their asses.

01:044:004 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,
           Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and
           when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye
           rewarded evil for good?

01:044:005 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed
           he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.

01:044:006 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.

01:044:007 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?
           God forbid that thy servants should do according to this
           thing:

01:044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we
           brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then
           should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?

01:044:009 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,
           and we also will be my lord's bondmen.

01:044:010 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he
           with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be
           blameless.

01:044:011 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,
           and opened every man his sack.

01:044:012 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the
           youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

01:044:013 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and
           returned to the city.

01:044:014 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was
           yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.

01:044:015 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have
           done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?

01:044:016 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we
           speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the
           iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants,
           both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.

01:044:017 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in
           whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as
           for you, get you up in peace unto your father.

01:044:018 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy
           servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let
           not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as
           Pharaoh.

01:044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a
           brother?

01:044:020 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a
           child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,
           and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.

01:044:021 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,
           that I may set mine eyes upon him.

01:044:022 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for
           if he should leave his father, his father would die.

01:044:023 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest
           brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.

01:044:024 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my
           father, we told him the words of my lord.

01:044:025 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.

01:044:026 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be
           with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's
           face, except our youngest brother be with us.

01:044:027 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife
           bare me two sons:

01:044:028 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in
           pieces; and I saw him not since:

01:044:029 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye
           shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.

01:044:030 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the
           lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the
           lad's life;

01:044:031 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with
           us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the
           gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.

01:044:032 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,
           saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the
           blame to my father for ever.

01:044:033 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of
           the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his
           brethren.

01:044:034 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with
           me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my
           father.

01:045:001 Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that
           stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.
           And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself
           known unto his brethren.

01:045:002 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh
           heard.

01:045:003 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father
           yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were
           troubled at his presence.

01:045:004 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray
           you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your
           brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.

01:045:005 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that
           ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve
           life.

01:045:006 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet
           there are five years, in the which there shall neither be
           earing nor harvest.

01:045:007 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the
           earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.

01:045:008 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he
           hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,
           and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.

01:045:009 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith
           thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down
           unto me, tarry not:

01:045:010 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be
           near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's
           children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou
           hast:

01:045:011 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of
           famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,
           come to poverty.

01:045:012 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother
           Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.

01:045:013 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of
           all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my
           father hither.

01:045:014 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and
           Benjamin wept upon his neck.

01:045:015 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and
           after that his brethren talked with him.

01:045:016 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,
           Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and
           his servants.

01:045:017 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do
           ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;

01:045:018 And take your father and your households, and come unto me:
           and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye
           shall eat the fat of the land.

01:045:019 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the
           land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and
           bring your father, and come.

01:045:020 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of
           Egypt is your's.

01:045:021 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them
           wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them
           provision for the way.

01:045:022 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to
           Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five
           changes of raiment.

01:045:023 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden
           with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with
           corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.

01:045:024 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said
           unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.

01:045:025 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of
           Canaan unto Jacob their father,

01:045:026 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor
           over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he
           believed them not.

01:045:027 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said
           unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to
           carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:

01:045:028 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I
           will go and see him before I die.

01:046:001 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
           Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father
           Isaac.

01:046:002 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and
           said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.

01:046:003 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go
           down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:

01:046:004 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely
           bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine
           eyes.

01:046:005 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel
           carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their
           wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

01:046:006 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had
           gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and
           all his seed with him:

01:046:007 His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his
           sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into
           Egypt.

01:046:008 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
           into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

01:046:009 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and
           Carmi.

01:046:010 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
           Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.

01:046:011 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

01:046:012 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez,
           and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the
           sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.

01:046:013 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and
           Shimron.

01:046:014 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.

01:046:015 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in
           Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons
           and his daughters were thirty and three.

01:046:016 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon,
           Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.

01:046:017 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and
           Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber,
           and Malchiel.

01:046:018 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his
           daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.

01:046:019 The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.

01:046:020 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and
           Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On
           bare unto him.

01:046:021 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
           Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.

01:046:022 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all
           the souls were fourteen.

01:046:023 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.

01:046:024 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and
           Shillem.

01:046:025 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
           daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were
           seven.

01:046:026 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out
           of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were
           threescore and six;

01:046:027 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two
           souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into
           Egypt, were threescore and ten.

01:046:028 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face
           unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.

01:046:029 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel
           his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he
           fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

01:046:030 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen
           thy face, because thou art yet alive.

01:046:031 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's
           house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My
           brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of
           Canaan, are come unto me;

01:046:032 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
           cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds,
           and all that they have.

01:046:033 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and
           shall say, What is your occupation?

01:046:034 That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle
           from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers:
           that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is
           an abomination unto the Egyptians.

01:047:001 Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my
           brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they
           have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they
           are in the land of Goshen.

01:047:002 And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented
           them unto Pharaoh.

01:047:003 And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation?
           And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both
           we, and also our fathers.

01:047:004 They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are
           we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks;
           for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore,
           we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.

01:047:005 And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy
           brethren are come unto thee:

01:047:006 The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make
           thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let
           them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among
           them, then make them rulers over my cattle.

01:047:007 And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before
           Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

01:047:008 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?

01:047:009 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my
           pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have
           the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained
           unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the
           days of their pilgrimage.

01:047:010 And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.

01:047:011 And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a
           possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in
           the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

01:047:012 And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his
           father's household, with bread, according to their families.

01:047:013 And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was
           very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of
           Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.

01:047:014 And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the
           land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which
           they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's
           house.

01:047:015 And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of
           Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us
           bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money
           faileth.

01:047:016 And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for
           your cattle, if money fail.

01:047:017 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave
           them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for
           the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them
           with bread for all their cattle for that year.

01:047:018 When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,
           and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that
           our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle;
           there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our
           bodies, and our lands:

01:047:019 Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our
           land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will
           be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live,
           and not die, that the land be not desolate.

01:047:020 And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the
           Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine
           prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.

01:047:021 And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end
           of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.

01:047:022 Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests
           had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their
           portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their
           lands.

01:047:023 Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you
           this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you,
           and ye shall sow the land.

01:047:024 And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give
           the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own,
           for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your
           households, and for food for your little ones.

01:047:025 And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in
           the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.

01:047:026 And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,
           that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of
           the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.

01:047:027 And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of
           Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and
           multiplied exceedingly.

01:047:028 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the
           whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.

01:047:029 And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his
           son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in
           thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal
           kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:

01:047:030 But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of
           Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will
           do as thou hast said.

01:047:031 And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel
           bowed himself upon the bed's head.

01:048:001 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,
           Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,
           Manasseh and Ephraim.

01:048:002 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh
           unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the
           bed.

01:048:003 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at
           Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

01:048:004 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and
           multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people;
           and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an
           everlasting possession.

01:048:005 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born
           unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into
           Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.

01:048:006 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be
           thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in
           their inheritance.

01:048:007 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in
           the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little
           way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of
           Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.

01:048:008 And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?

01:048:009 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God
           hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray
           thee, unto me, and I will bless them.

01:048:010 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not
           see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them,
           and embraced them.

01:048:011 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy
           face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.

01:048:012 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he
           bowed himself with his face to the earth.

01:048:013 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
           Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward
           Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.

01:048:014 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon
           Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon
           Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was
           the firstborn.

01:048:015 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
           Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life
           long unto this day,

01:048:016 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and
           let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers
           Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the
           midst of the earth.

01:048:017 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon
           the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his
           father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto
           Manasseh's head.

01:048:018 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this
           is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.

01:048:019 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know
           it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great:
           but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and
           his seed shall become a multitude of nations.

01:048:020 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
           bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and
           he set Ephraim before Manasseh.

01:048:021 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be
           with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.

01:048:022 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
           which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and
           with my bow.

01:049:001 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
           together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in
           the last days.

01:049:002 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and
           hearken unto Israel your father.

01:049:003 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of
           my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of
           power:

01:049:004 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest
           up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to
           my couch.

01:049:005 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in
           their habitations.

01:049:006 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their
           assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger
           they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a
           wall.

01:049:007 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for
           it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in
           Israel.

01:049:008 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand
           shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children
           shall bow down before thee.

01:049:009 Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone
           up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion;
           who shall rouse him up?

01:049:010 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
           between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the
           gathering of the people be.

01:049:011 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the
           choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes
           in the blood of grapes:

01:049:012 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with
           milk.

01:049:013 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be
           for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.

01:049:014 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:

01:049:015 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was
           pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant
           unto tribute.

01:049:016 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

01:049:017 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that
           biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.

01:049:018 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.

01:049:019 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the
           last.

01:049:020 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
           dainties.

01:049:021 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.

01:049:022 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
           whose branches run over the wall:

01:049:023 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and
           hated him:

01:049:024 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were
           made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from
           thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)

01:049:025 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the
           Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,
           blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the
           breasts, and of the womb:

01:049:026 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings
           of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting
           hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown
           of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.

01:049:027 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour
           the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.

01:049:028 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that
           their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one
           according to his blessing he blessed them.

01:049:029 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered
           unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in
           the field of Ephron the Hittite,

01:049:030 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
           Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the
           field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a
           buryingplace.

01:049:031 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they
           buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.

01:049:032 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
           from the children of Heth.

01:049:033 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
           gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost,
           and was gathered unto his people.

01:050:001 And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and
           kissed him.

01:050:002 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
           father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.

01:050:003 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled
           the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians
           mourned for him threescore and ten days.

01:050:004 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
           the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in
           your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

01:050:005 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which
           I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou
           bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my
           father, and I will come again.

01:050:006 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
           made thee swear.

01:050:007 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up
           all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all
           the elders of the land of Egypt,

01:050:008 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his
           father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and
           their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.

01:050:009 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it
           was a very great company.

01:050:010 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
           Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore
           lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.

01:050:011 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
           mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous
           mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called
           Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.

01:050:012 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:

01:050:013 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried
           him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham
           bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of
           Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

01:050:014 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
           that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried
           his father.

01:050:015 And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,
           they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will
           certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.

01:050:016 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
           command before he died, saying,

01:050:017 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the
           trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto
           thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the
           servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they
           spake unto him.

01:050:018 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and
           they said, Behold, we be thy servants.

01:050:019 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of
           God?

01:050:020 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it
           unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much
           people alive.

01:050:021 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little
           ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.

01:050:022 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and
           Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.

01:050:023 And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the
           children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up
           upon Joseph's knees.

01:050:024 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely
           visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which
           he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

01:050:025 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God
           will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from
           hence.

01:050:026 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
           embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

Book 02        Exodus

02:001:001 Now these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
           into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.

02:001:002 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

02:001:003 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

02:001:004 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.

02:001:005 And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were
           seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.

02:001:006 And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that
           generation.

02:001:007 And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased
           abundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty; and
           the land was filled with them.

02:001:008 Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, which knew not
           Joseph.

02:001:009 And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the
           children of Israel are more and mightier than we:

02:001:010 Come on, let us deal wisely with them; lest they multiply, and
           it come to pass, that, when there falleth out any war, they
           join also unto our enemies, and fight against us, and so get
           them up out of the land.

02:001:011 Therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them
           with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure
           cities, Pithom and Raamses.

02:001:012 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
           grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.

02:001:013 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with
           rigour:

02:001:014 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter,
           and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all
           their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour.

02:001:015 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which
           the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other
           Puah:

02:001:016 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew
           women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye
           shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.

02:001:017 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt
           commanded them, but saved the men children alive.

02:001:018 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto
           them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men
           children alive?

02:001:019 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women
           are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are
           delivered ere the midwives come in unto them.

02:001:020 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people
           multiplied, and waxed very mighty.

02:001:021 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he
           made them houses.

02:001:022 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is
           born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall
           save alive.

02:002:001 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
           daughter of Levi.

02:002:002 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him
           that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.

02:002:003 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an
           ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and
           put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the
           river's brink.

02:002:004 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to
           him.

02:002:005 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
           river; and her maidens walked along by the river's side; and
           when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to
           fetch it.

02:002:006 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold,
           the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This
           is one of the Hebrews' children.

02:002:007 Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and
           call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse
           the child for thee?

02:002:008 And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and
           called the child's mother.

02:002:009 And Pharaoh's daughter said unto her, Take this child away,
           and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the
           women took the child, and nursed it.

02:002:010 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's
           daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name
           Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.

02:002:011 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that
           he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens:
           and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his
           brethren.

02:002:012 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that
           there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the
           sand.

02:002:013 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
           Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the
           wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?

02:002:014 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?
           intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And
           Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.

02:002:015 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses.
           But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land
           of Midian: and he sat down by a well.

02:002:016 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came
           and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's
           flock.

02:002:017 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up
           and helped them, and watered their flock.

02:002:018 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it
           that ye are come so soon to day?

02:002:019 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
           shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the
           flock.

02:002:020 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it
           that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.

02:002:021 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
           Zipporah his daughter.

02:002:022 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
           said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.

02:002:023 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
           died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the
           bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by
           reason of the bondage.

02:002:024 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
           with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

02:002:025 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had
           respect unto them.

02:003:001 Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the
           priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the
           desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

02:003:002 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a flame of fire
           out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the
           bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

02:003:003 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great
           sight, why the bush is not burnt.

02:003:004 And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called
           unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.
           And he said, Here am I.

02:003:005 And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off
           thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.

02:003:006 Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of
           Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid
           his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.

02:003:007 And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my
           people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason
           of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows;

02:003:008 And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the
           Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good
           land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey;
           unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
           Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
           Jebusites.

02:003:009 Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is
           come unto me: and I have also seen the oppression wherewith
           the Egyptians oppress them.

02:003:010 Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that
           thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out
           of Egypt.

02:003:011 And Moses said unto God, Who am I, that I should go unto
           Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel
           out of Egypt?

02:003:012 And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be
           a token unto thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast
           brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon
           this mountain.

02:003:013 And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children
           of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers
           hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his
           name? what shall I say unto them?

02:003:014 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
           shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me
           unto you.

02:003:015 And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the
           children of Israel, the LORD God of your fathers, the God of
           Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me
           unto you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial
           unto all generations.

02:003:016 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto
           them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of
           Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared unto me, saying, I have surely
           visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt:

02:003:017 And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of
           Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and
           the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
           Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.

02:003:018 And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou
           and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall
           say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us:
           and now let us go, we beseech thee, three days' journey into
           the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.

02:003:019 And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no,
           not by a mighty hand.

02:003:020 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my
           wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that
           he will let you go.

02:003:021 And I will give this people favour in the sight of the
           Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye
           shall not go empty.

02:003:022 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that
           sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,
           and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon
           your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

02:004:001 And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not
           believe me, nor hearken unto my voice: for they will say, The
           LORD hath not appeared unto thee.

02:004:002 And the LORD said unto him, What is that in thine hand? And he
           said, A rod.

02:004:003 And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the
           ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before
           it.

02:004:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take
           it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and
           it became a rod in his hand:

02:004:005 That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the
           God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath
           appeared unto thee.

02:004:006 And the LORD said furthermore unto him, Put now thine hand
           into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when
           he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow.

02:004:007 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosom again. And he put
           his hand into his bosom again; and plucked it out of his
           bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.

02:004:008 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee,
           neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will
           believe the voice of the latter sign.

02:004:009 And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these
           two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt
           take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land:
           and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become
           blood upon the dry land.

02:004:010 And Moses said unto the LORD, O my LORD, I am not eloquent,
           neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy
           servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.

02:004:011 And the LORD said unto him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who
           maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have
           not I the LORD?

02:004:012 Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee
           what thou shalt say.

02:004:013 And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him
           whom thou wilt send.

02:004:014 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he
           said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can
           speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee:
           and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.

02:004:015 And thou shalt speak unto him, and put words in his mouth: and
           I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach
           you what ye shall do.

02:004:016 And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people: and he shall
           be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou
           shalt be to him instead of God.

02:004:017 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou
           shalt do signs.

02:004:018 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father in law, and
           said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my
           brethren which are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet
           alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.

02:004:019 And the LORD said unto Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt:
           for all the men are dead which sought thy life.

02:004:020 And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an
           ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the
           rod of God in his hand.

02:004:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, When thou goest to return into
           Egypt, see that thou do all those wonders before Pharaoh,
           which I have put in thine hand: but I will harden his heart,
           that he shall not let the people go.

02:004:022 And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel
           is my son, even my firstborn:

02:004:023 And I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and
           if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son,
           even thy firstborn.

02:004:024 And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met
           him, and sought to kill him.

02:004:025 Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of
           her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody
           husband art thou to me.

02:004:026 So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art,
           because of the circumcision.

02:004:027 And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet
           Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and
           kissed him.

02:004:028 And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent
           him, and all the signs which he had commanded him.

02:004:029 And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders
           of the children of Israel:

02:004:030 And Aaron spake all the words which the LORD had spoken unto
           Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.

02:004:031 And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had
           visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon
           their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

02:005:001 And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus
           saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may
           hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.

02:005:002 And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his
           voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I
           let Israel go.

02:005:003 And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us
           go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and
           sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with
           pestilence, or with the sword.

02:005:004 And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Moses
           and Aaron, let the people from their works? get you unto your
           burdens.

02:005:005 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many,
           and ye make them rest from their burdens.

02:005:006 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the
           people, and their officers, saying,

02:005:007 Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as
           heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.

02:005:008 And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye
           shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish ought thereof: for
           they be idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and
           sacrifice to our God.

02:005:009 Let there more work be laid upon the men, that they may labour
           therein; and let them not regard vain words.

02:005:010 And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their
           officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith
           Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.

02:005:011 Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not ought of
           your work shall be diminished.

02:005:012 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of
           Egypt to gather stubble instead of straw.

02:005:013 And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works,
           your daily tasks, as when there was straw.

02:005:014 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's
           taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded,
           Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both
           yesterday and to day, as heretofore?

02:005:015 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried
           unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy
           servants?

02:005:016 There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us,
           Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the
           fault is in thine own people.

02:005:017 But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let
           us go and do sacrifice to the LORD.

02:005:018 Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given
           you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.

02:005:019 And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they
           were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not minish
           ought from your bricks of your daily task.

02:005:020 And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they
           came forth from Pharaoh:

02:005:021 And they said unto them, The LORD look upon you, and judge;
           because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of
           Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in
           their hand to slay us.

02:005:022 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, LORD, wherefore
           hast thou so evil entreated this people? why is it that thou
           hast sent me?

02:005:023 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done
           evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at
           all.

02:006:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will
           do to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall he let them go,
           and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.

02:006:002 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD:

02:006:003 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by
           the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not
           known to them.

02:006:004 And I have also established my covenant with them, to give
           them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein
           they were strangers.

02:006:005 And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel,
           whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my
           covenant.

02:006:006 Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and
           I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,
           and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you
           with a stretched out arm, and with great judgments:

02:006:007 And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a
           God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, which
           bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

02:006:008 And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I
           did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I
           will give it you for an heritage: I am the LORD.

02:006:009 And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel: but they
           hearkened not unto Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel
           bondage.

02:006:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:006:011 Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the
           children of Israel go out of his land.

02:006:012 And Moses spake before the LORD, saying, Behold, the children
           of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh
           hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?

02:006:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, and gave them a
           charge unto the children of Israel, and unto Pharaoh king of
           Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of
           Egypt.

02:006:014 These be the heads of their fathers' houses: The sons of
           Reuben the firstborn of Israel; Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and
           Carmi: these be the families of Reuben.

02:006:015 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
           Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman:
           these are the families of Simeon.

02:006:016 And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
           generations; Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari: and the years of
           the life of Levi were an hundred thirty and seven years.

02:006:017 The sons of Gershon; Libni, and Shimi, according to their
           families.

02:006:018 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and
           Uzziel: and the years of the life of Kohath were an hundred
           thirty and three years.

02:006:019 And the sons of Merari; Mahali and Mushi: these are the
           families of Levi according to their generations.

02:006:020 And Amram took him Jochebed his father's sister to wife; and
           she bare him Aaron and Moses: and the years of the life of
           Amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years.

02:006:021 And the sons of Izhar; Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

02:006:022 And the sons of Uzziel; Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Zithri.

02:006:023 And Aaron took him Elisheba, daughter of Amminadab, sister of
           Naashon, to wife; and she bare him Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar,
           and Ithamar.

02:006:024 And the sons of Korah; Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph: these
           are the families of the Korhites.

02:006:025 And Eleazar Aaron's son took him one of the daughters of
           Putiel to wife; and she bare him Phinehas: these are the heads
           of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.

02:006:026 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the LORD said, Bring
           out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt according to
           their armies.

02:006:027 These are they which spake to Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring
           out the children of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses
           and Aaron.

02:006:028 And it came to pass on the day when the LORD spake unto Moses
           in the land of Egypt,

02:006:029 That the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, I am the LORD: speak
           thou unto Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I say unto thee.

02:006:030 And Moses said before the LORD, Behold, I am of uncircumcised
           lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken unto me?

02:007:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to
           Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.

02:007:002 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy
           brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of
           Israel out of his land.

02:007:003 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and
           my wonders in the land of Egypt.

02:007:004 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
           upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the
           children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great
           judgments.

02:007:005 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I
           stretch forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children
           of Israel from among them.

02:007:006 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did
           they.

02:007:007 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and
           three years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.

02:007:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

02:007:009 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for
           you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it
           before Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.

02:007:010 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as
           the LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before
           Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

02:007:011 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now
           the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with
           their enchantments.

02:007:012 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became
           serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

02:007:013 And he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he hearkened not unto
           them; as the LORD had said.

02:007:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened, he
           refuseth to let the people go.

02:007:015 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto
           the water; and thou shalt stand by the river's brink against
           he come; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou
           take in thine hand.

02:007:016 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
           sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may
           serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou
           wouldest not hear.

02:007:017 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the
           LORD: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand
           upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be
           turned to blood.

02:007:018 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river
           shall stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the
           water of the river.

02:007:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod,
           and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon
           their streams, upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and
           upon all their pools of water, that they may become blood; and
           that there may be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both
           in vessels of wood, and in vessels of stone.

02:007:020 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he
           lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the
           river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his
           servants; and all the waters that were in the river were
           turned to blood.

02:007:021 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank,
           and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river;
           and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.

02:007:022 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
           Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto
           them; as the LORD had said.

02:007:023 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set
           his heart to this also.

02:007:024 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water
           to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.

02:007:025 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten
           the river.

02:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto
           him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may
           serve me.

02:008:002 And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all
           thy borders with frogs:

02:008:003 And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall
           go up and come into thine house, and into thy bedchamber, and
           upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy
           people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneadingtroughs:

02:008:004 And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people,
           and upon all thy servants.

02:008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch forth
           thine hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and
           over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of
           Egypt.

02:008:006 And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and
           the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

02:008:007 And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought
           up frogs upon the land of Egypt.

02:008:008 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat the
           LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my
           people; and I will let the people go, that they may do
           sacrifice unto the LORD.

02:008:009 And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I
           intreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to
           destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may
           remain in the river only?

02:008:010 And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy
           word: that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the
           LORD our God.

02:008:011 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and
           from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in
           the river only.

02:008:012 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried
           unto the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought
           against Pharaoh.

02:008:013 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs
           died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the
           fields.

02:008:014 And they gathered them together upon heaps: and the land
           stank.

02:008:015 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his
           heart, and hearkened not unto them; as the LORD had said.

02:008:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy
           rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice
           throughout all the land of Egypt.

02:008:017 And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his
           rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in
           man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice
           throughout all the land of Egypt.

02:008:018 And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring
           forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man,
           and upon beast.

02:008:019 Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of
           God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not
           unto them; as the LORD had said.

02:008:020 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
           and stand before Pharaoh; lo, he cometh forth to the water;
           and say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that
           they may serve me.

02:008:021 Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send
           swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy
           people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians
           shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon
           they are.

02:008:022 And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my
           people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the
           end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the
           earth.

02:008:023 And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to
           morrow shall this sign be.

02:008:024 And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies
           into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and
           into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason
           of the swarm of flies.

02:008:025 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye,
           sacrifice to your God in the land.

02:008:026 And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall
           sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our
           God: lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians
           before their eyes, and will they not stone us?

02:008:027 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and
           sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.

02:008:028 And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to
           the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very
           far away: intreat for me.

02:008:029 And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will intreat
           the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh,
           from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not
           Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go
           to sacrifice to the LORD.

02:008:030 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

02:008:031 And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he
           removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants,
           and from his people; there remained not one.

02:008:032 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither
           would he let the people go.

02:009:001 Then the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell
           him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go,
           that they may serve me.

02:009:002 For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still,

02:009:003 Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which is in
           the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels,
           upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very
           grievous murrain.

02:009:004 And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel and the
           cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that is
           the children's of Israel.

02:009:005 And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the LORD
           shall do this thing in the land.

02:009:006 And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle
           of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel
           died not one.

02:009:007 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the cattle
           of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened,
           and he did not let the people go.

02:009:008 And the LORD said unto Moses and unto Aaron, Take to you
           handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it
           toward the heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.

02:009:009 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and
           shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon
           beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.

02:009:010 And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;
           and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil
           breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast.

02:009:011 And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the
           boils; for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the
           Egyptians.

02:009:012 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened
           not unto them; as the LORD had spoken unto Moses.

02:009:013 And the LORD said unto Moses, Rise up early in the morning,
           and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith the
           LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve
           me.

02:009:014 For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart,
           and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest
           know that there is none like me in all the earth.

02:009:015 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and
           thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the
           earth.

02:009:016 And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, for to
           shew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared
           throughout all the earth.

02:009:017 As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt
           not let them go?

02:009:018 Behold, to morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a
           very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the
           foundation thereof even until now.

02:009:019 Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou
           hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be
           found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail
           shall come down upon them, and they shall die.

02:009:020 He that feared the word of the LORD among the servants of
           Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses:

02:009:021 And he that regarded not the word of the LORD left his
           servants and his cattle in the field.

02:009:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward
           heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon
           man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field,
           throughout the land of Egypt.

02:009:023 And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and the LORD
           sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground;
           and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.

02:009:024 So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very
           grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of
           Egypt since it became a nation.

02:009:025 And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that
           was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every
           herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.

02:009:026 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,
           was there no hail.

02:009:027 And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said
           unto them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and
           I and my people are wicked.

02:009:028 Intreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more
           mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye
           shall stay no longer.

02:009:029 And Moses said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city,
           I will spread abroad my hands unto the LORD; and the thunder
           shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou
           mayest know how that the earth is the LORD's.

02:009:030 But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet
           fear the LORD God.

02:009:031 And the flax and the barley was smitten: for the barley was in
           the ear, and the flax was bolled.

02:009:032 But the wheat and the rie were not smitten: for they were not
           grown up.

02:009:033 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad
           his hands unto the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and
           the rain was not poured upon the earth.

02:009:034 And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the
           thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his
           heart, he and his servants.

02:009:035 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let
           the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses.

02:010:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have
           hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I
           might shew these my signs before him:

02:010:002 And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy
           son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs
           which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am
           the LORD.

02:010:003 And Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him,
           Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou
           refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that
           they may serve me.

02:010:004 Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to morrow
           will I bring the locusts into thy coast:

02:010:005 And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be
           able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that
           which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and
           shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field:

02:010:006 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy
           servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither
           thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day
           that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned
           himself, and went out from Pharaoh.

02:010:007 And Pharaoh's servants said unto him, How long shall this man
           be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve the
           LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed?

02:010:008 And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he
           said unto them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they
           that shall go?

02:010:009 And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old,
           with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with
           our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto the LORD.

02:010:010 And he said unto them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will
           let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is
           before you.

02:010:011 Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that
           ye did desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's
           presence.

02:010:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
           land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the
           land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that
           the hail hath left.

02:010:013 And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and
           the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and
           all that night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought
           the locusts.

02:010:014 And the locust went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested
           in all the coasts of Egypt: very grievous were they; before
           them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them
           shall be such.

02:010:015 For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land
           was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all
           the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there
           remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs of
           the field, through all the land of Egypt.

02:010:016 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said,
           I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you.

02:010:017 Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and
           intreat the LORD your God, that he may take away from me this
           death only.

02:010:018 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the LORD.

02:010:019 And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind, which took away
           the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea; there remained
           not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.

02:010:020 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not
           let the children of Israel go.

02:010:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward
           heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt,
           even darkness which may be felt.

02:010:022 And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there
           was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days:

02:010:023 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for
           three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their
           dwellings.

02:010:024 And Pharaoh called unto Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the
           LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your
           little ones also go with you.

02:010:025 And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt
           offerings, that we may sacrifice unto the LORD our God.

02:010:026 Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not an hoof be
           left behind; for thereof must we take to serve the LORD our
           God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until
           we come thither.

02:010:027 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let
           them go.

02:010:028 And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to
           thyself, see my face no more; for in that day thou seest my
           face thou shalt die.

02:010:029 And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face
           again no more.

02:011:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more
           upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go
           hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you
           out hence altogether.

02:011:002 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow
           of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour, jewels of
           silver and jewels of gold.

02:011:003 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
           Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land
           of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight
           of the people.

02:011:004 And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go
           out into the midst of Egypt:

02:011:005 And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the
           first born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto
           the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill; and
           all the firstborn of beasts.

02:011:006 And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of
           Egypt, such as there was none like it, nor shall be like it
           any more.

02:011:007 But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move
           his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that
           the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and
           Israel.

02:011:008 And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow
           down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the
           people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he
           went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.

02:011:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken unto
           you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.

02:011:010 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and
           the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let
           the children of Israel go out of his land.

02:012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt
           saying,

02:012:002 This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it shall
           be the first month of the year to you.

02:012:003 Speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the
           tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a
           lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an
           house:

02:012:004 And if the household be too little for the lamb, let him and
           his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the
           number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall
           make your count for the lamb.

02:012:005 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year:
           ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:

02:012:006 And ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same
           month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel
           shall kill it in the evening.

02:012:007 And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two
           side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein
           they shall eat it.

02:012:008 And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire,
           and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.

02:012:009 Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast
           with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance
           thereof.

02:012:010 And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and
           that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn
           with fire.

02:012:011 And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes
           on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it
           in haste: it is the LORD's passover.

02:012:012 For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will
           smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and
           beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute
           judgment: I am the LORD.

02:012:013 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses
           where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you,
           and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I
           smite the land of Egypt.

02:012:014 And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall
           keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye
           shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.

02:012:015 Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day
           ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whosoever
           eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh
           day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

02:012:016 And in the first day there shall be an holy convocation, and
           in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you;
           no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every
           man must eat, that only may be done of you.

02:012:017 And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in
           this selfsame day have I brought your armies out of the land
           of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your
           generations by an ordinance for ever.

02:012:018 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at
           even, ye shall eat unleavened bread, until the one and
           twentieth day of the month at even.

02:012:019 Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for
           whosoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall
           be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a
           stranger, or born in the land.

02:012:020 Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall
           ye eat unleavened bread.

02:012:021 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto
           them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families,
           and kill the passover.

02:012:022 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood
           that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side
           posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you
           shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.

02:012:023 For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and
           when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side
           posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer
           the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.

02:012:024 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and
           to thy sons for ever.

02:012:025 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which
           the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye
           shall keep this service.

02:012:026 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto
           you, What mean ye by this service?

02:012:027 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD's passover,
           who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,
           when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the
           people bowed the head and worshipped.

02:012:028 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had
           commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.

02:012:029 And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the
           firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh
           that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that
           was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.

02:012:030 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants,
           and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for
           there was not a house where there was not one dead.

02:012:031 And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise up,
           and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the
           children of Israel; and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said.

02:012:032 Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be
           gone; and bless me also.

02:012:033 And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might
           send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We be all
           dead men.

02:012:034 And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their
           kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their
           shoulders.

02:012:035 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;
           and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and
           jewels of gold, and raiment:

02:012:036 And the LORD gave the people favour in the sight of the
           Egyptians, so that they lent unto them such things as they
           required. And they spoiled the Egyptians.

02:012:037 And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth,
           about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside
           children.

02:012:038 And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and
           herds, even very much cattle.

02:012:039 And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they
           brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened; because
           they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither
           had they prepared for themselves any victual.

02:012:040 Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in
           Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.

02:012:041 And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty
           years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the
           hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.

02:012:042 It is a night to be much observed unto the LORD for bringing
           them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the
           LORD to be observed of all the children of Israel in their
           generations.

02:012:043 And the LORD said unto Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance
           of the passover: There shall no stranger eat thereof:

02:012:044 But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou
           hast circumcised him, then shall he eat thereof.

02:012:045 A foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof.

02:012:046 In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth
           ought of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye
           break a bone thereof.

02:012:047 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

02:012:048 And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the
           passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and
           then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one
           that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall
           eat thereof.

02:012:049 One law shall be to him that is homeborn, and unto the
           stranger that sojourneth among you.

02:012:050 Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded
           Moses and Aaron, so did they.

02:012:051 And it came to pass the selfsame day, that the LORD did bring
           the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their
           armies.

02:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:013:002 Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the
           womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast:
           it is mine.

02:013:003 And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye
           came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by
           strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place:
           there shall no leavened bread be eaten.

02:013:004 This day came ye out in the month Abib.

02:013:005 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
           of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the
           Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware unto thy fathers to
           give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt
           keep this service in this month.

02:013:006 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh
           day shall be a feast to the LORD.

02:013:007 Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days; and there shall no
           leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be
           leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters.

02:013:008 And thou shalt shew thy son in that day, saying, This is done
           because of that which the LORD did unto me when I came forth
           out of Egypt.

02:013:009 And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for
           a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD's law may be in
           thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee
           out of Egypt.

02:013:010 Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from
           year to year.

02:013:011 And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land
           of the Canaanites, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers,
           and shall give it thee,

02:013:012 That thou shalt set apart unto the LORD all that openeth the
           matrix, and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou
           hast; the males shall be the LORD's.

02:013:013 And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb;
           and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his
           neck: and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt
           thou redeem.

02:013:014 And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come,
           saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By
           strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the
           house of bondage:

02:013:015 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that
           the LORD slew all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the
           firstborn of man, and the firstborn of beast: therefore I
           sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being
           males; but all the firstborn of my children I redeem.

02:013:016 And it shall be for a token upon thine hand, and for frontlets
           between thine eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought
           us forth out of Egypt.

02:013:017 And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that
           God led them not through the way of the land of the
           Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest
           peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they
           return to Egypt:

02:013:018 But God led the people about, through the way of the
           wilderness of the Red sea: and the children of Israel went up
           harnessed out of the land of Egypt.

02:013:019 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had
           straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely
           visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.

02:013:020 And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in
           Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.

02:013:021 And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud,
           to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to
           give them light; to go by day and night:

02:013:022 He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the
           pillar of fire by night, from before the people.

02:014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:014:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp
           before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against
           Baalzephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea.

02:014:003 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are
           entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in.

02:014:004 And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow after
           them; and I will be honoured upon Pharaoh, and upon all his
           host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they
           did so.

02:014:005 And it was told the king of Egypt that the people fled: and
           the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against
           the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have
           let Israel go from serving us?

02:014:006 And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him:

02:014:007 And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots
           of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.

02:014:008 And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
           he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of
           Israel went out with an high hand.

02:014:009 But the Egyptians pursued after them, all the horses and
           chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and
           overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before
           Baalzephon.

02:014:010 And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up
           their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and
           they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out
           unto the LORD.

02:014:011 And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in
           Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness?
           wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us, to carry us forth out
           of Egypt?

02:014:012 Is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt, saying,
           Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been
           better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die
           in the wilderness.

02:014:013 And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and
           see the salvation of the LORD, which he will shew to you to
           day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to day, ye shall see
           them again no more for ever.

02:014:014 The LORD shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.

02:014:015 And the LORD said unto Moses, Wherefore criest thou unto me?
           speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward:

02:014:016 But lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand over the
           sea, and divide it: and the children of Israel shall go on dry
           ground through the midst of the sea.

02:014:017 And I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and
           they shall follow them: and I will get me honour upon Pharaoh,
           and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his
           horsemen.

02:014:018 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have
           gotten me honour upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his
           horsemen.

02:014:019 And the angel of God, which went before the camp of Israel,
           removed and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went
           from before their face, and stood behind them:

02:014:020 And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of
           Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave
           light by night to these: so that the one came not near the
           other all the night.

02:014:021 And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD
           caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that
           night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

02:014:022 And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon
           the dry ground: and the waters were a wall unto them on their
           right hand, and on their left.

02:014:023 And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst
           of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his
           horsemen.

02:014:024 And it came to pass, that in the morning watch the LORD looked
           unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and
           of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians,

02:014:025 And took off their chariot wheels, that they drave them
           heavily: so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face
           of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the
           Egyptians.

02:014:026 And the LORD said unto Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the
           sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon
           their chariots, and upon their horsemen.

02:014:027 And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea
           returned to his strength when the morning appeared; and the
           Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the
           Egyptians in the midst of the sea.

02:014:028 And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the
           horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea
           after them; there remained not so much as one of them.

02:014:029 But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst
           of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their
           right hand, and on their left.

02:014:030 Thus the LORD saved Israel that day out of the hand of the
           Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea
           shore.

02:014:031 And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the
           Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the
           LORD, and his servant Moses.

02:015:001 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
           LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he
           hath triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he
           thrown into the sea.

02:015:002 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my
           salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation;
           my father's God, and I will exalt him.

02:015:003 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.

02:015:004 Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
           chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.

02:015:005 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
           stone.

02:015:006 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right
           hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.

02:015:007 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
           them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath,
           which consumed them as stubble.

02:015:008 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
           together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths
           were congealed in the heart of the sea.

02:015:009 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide
           the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw
           my sword, my hand shall destroy them.

02:015:010 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank
           as lead in the mighty waters.

02:015:011 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like
           thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

02:015:012 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.

02:015:013 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
           redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
           habitation.

02:015:014 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold
           on the inhabitants of Palestina.

02:015:015 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of
           Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants
           of Canaan shall melt away.

02:015:016 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine
           arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass
           over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast
           purchased.

02:015:017 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
           thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made
           for thee to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy
           hands have established.

02:015:018 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.

02:015:019 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with
           his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the
           waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went
           on dry land in the midst of the sea.

02:015:020 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
           in her hand; and all the women went out after her with
           timbrels and with dances.

02:015:021 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
           triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown
           into the sea.

02:015:022 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out
           into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the
           wilderness, and found no water.

02:015:023 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the
           waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of
           it was called Marah.

02:015:024 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
           drink?

02:015:025 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree,
           which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made
           sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and
           there he proved them,

02:015:026 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the
           LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight,
           and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his
           statutes, I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I
           have brought upon the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that
           healeth thee.

02:015:027 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
           threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the
           waters.

02:016:001 And they took their journey from Elim, and all the
           congregation of the children of Israel came unto the
           wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the
           fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of
           the land of Egypt.

02:016:002 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured
           against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:

02:016:003 And the children of Israel said unto them, Would to God we had
           died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat
           by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for
           ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this
           whole assembly with hunger.

02:016:004 Then said the LORD unto Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from
           heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a
           certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they
           will walk in my law, or no.

02:016:005 And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall
           prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as
           much as they gather daily.

02:016:006 And Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At
           even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out
           from the land of Egypt:

02:016:007 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD;
           for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what
           are we, that ye murmur against us?

02:016:008 And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in
           the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the
           full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye
           murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not
           against us, but against the LORD.

02:016:009 And Moses spake unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of
           the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath
           heard your murmurings.

02:016:010 And it came to pass, as Aaron spake unto the whole
           congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked
           toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD
           appeared in the cloud.

02:016:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:016:012 I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak
           unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the
           morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that
           I am the LORD your God.

02:016:013 And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and
           covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about
           the host.

02:016:014 And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face
           of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as
           the hoar frost on the ground.

02:016:015 And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
           another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And Moses
           said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given
           you to eat.

02:016:016 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it
           every man according to his eating, an omer for every man,
           according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for
           them which are in his tents.

02:016:017 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more,
           some less.

02:016:018 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much
           had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack;
           they gathered every man according to his eating.

02:016:019 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.

02:016:020 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of
           them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and
           stank: and Moses was wroth with them.

02:016:021 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his
           eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.

02:016:022 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice
           as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of
           the congregation came and told Moses.

02:016:023 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said,
           To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake
           that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will
           seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be
           kept until the morning.

02:016:024 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it
           did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.

02:016:025 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto
           the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field.

02:016:026 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is
           the sabbath, in it there shall be none.

02:016:027 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on
           the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.

02:016:028 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my
           commandments and my laws?

02:016:029 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore
           he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye
           every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the
           seventh day.

02:016:030 So the people rested on the seventh day.

02:016:031 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it
           was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like
           wafers made with honey.

02:016:032 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth,
           Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they
           may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness,
           when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.

02:016:033 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of
           manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for
           your generations.

02:016:034 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the
           Testimony, to be kept.

02:016:035 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until
           they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they
           came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.

02:016:036 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

02:017:001 And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed
           from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to
           the commandment of the LORD, and pitched in Rephidim: and
           there was no water for the people to drink.

02:017:002 Wherefore the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us
           water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide
           ye with me? wherefore do ye tempt the LORD?

02:017:003 And the people thirsted there for water; and the people
           murmured against Moses, and said, Wherefore is this that thou
           hast brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children
           and our cattle with thirst?

02:017:004 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, What shall I do unto
           this people? they be almost ready to stone me.

02:017:005 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go on before the people, and
           take with thee of the elders of Israel; and thy rod, wherewith
           thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and go.

02:017:006 Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb;
           and thou shalt smite the rock, and there shall come water out
           of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the
           sight of the elders of Israel.

02:017:007 And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,
           because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because
           they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not?

02:017:008 Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

02:017:009 And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out,
           fight with Amalek: to morrow I will stand on the top of the
           hill with the rod of God in mine hand.

02:017:010 So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with
           Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the
           hill.

02:017:011 And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
           prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

02:017:012 But Moses hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it
           under him, and he sat thereon; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his
           hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other
           side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the
           sun.

02:017:013 And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of
           the sword.

02:017:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write this for a memorial in a
           book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will
           utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.

02:017:015 And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it
           Jehovahnissi:

02:017:016 For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will
           have war with Amalek from generation to generation.

02:018:001 When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father in law, heard
           of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,
           and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;

02:018:002 Then Jethro, Moses' father in law, took Zipporah, Moses' wife,
           after he had sent her back,

02:018:003 And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom;
           for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:

02:018:004 And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my
           father, said he, was mine help, and delivered me from the
           sword of Pharaoh:

02:018:005 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, came with his sons and his
           wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the
           mount of God:

02:018:006 And he said unto Moses, I thy father in law Jethro am come
           unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.

02:018:007 And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did
           obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their
           welfare; and they came into the tent.

02:018:008 And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done
           unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all
           the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the
           LORD delivered them.

02:018:009 And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had
           done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the
           Egyptians.

02:018:010 And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you
           out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of
           Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of
           the Egyptians.

02:018:011 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the
           thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.

02:018:012 And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and
           sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of
           Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.

02:018:013 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the
           people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto
           the evening.

02:018:014 And when Moses' father in law saw all that he did to the
           people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the
           people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people
           stand by thee from morning unto even?

02:018:015 And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come
           unto me to enquire of God:

02:018:016 When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge
           between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes
           of God, and his laws.

02:018:017 And Moses' father in law said unto him, The thing that thou
           doest is not good.

02:018:018 Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is
           with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not
           able to perform it thyself alone.

02:018:019 Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God
           shall be with thee: Be thou for the people to God-ward, that
           thou mayest bring the causes unto God:

02:018:020 And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt shew
           them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they
           must do.

02:018:021 Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men,
           such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place
           such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of
           hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:

02:018:022 And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be,
           that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every
           small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for
           thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.

02:018:023 If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then
           thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also
           go to their place in peace.

02:018:024 So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law, and did
           all that he had said.

02:018:025 And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them
           heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of
           hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

02:018:026 And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes
           they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged
           themselves.

02:018:027 And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way
           into his own land.

02:019:001 In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone
           forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into
           the wilderness of Sinai.

02:019:002 For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the
           desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there
           Israel camped before the mount.

02:019:003 And Moses went up unto God, and the LORD called unto him out
           of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of
           Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;

02:019:004 Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you
           on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself.

02:019:005 Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my
           covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above
           all people: for all the earth is mine:

02:019:006 And ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy
           nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the
           children of Israel.

02:019:007 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and
           laid before their faces all these words which the LORD
           commanded him.

02:019:008 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the
           LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of
           the people unto the LORD.

02:019:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
           cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and
           believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people
           unto the LORD.

02:019:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify
           them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,

02:019:011 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD
           will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount
           Sinai.

02:019:012 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying,
           Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or
           touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be
           surely put to death:

02:019:013 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be
           stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall
           not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up
           to the mount.

02:019:014 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and
           sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.

02:019:015 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day:
           come not at your wives.

02:019:016 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that
           there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the
           mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that
           all the people that was in the camp trembled.

02:019:017 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet
           with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.

02:019:018 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD
           descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as
           the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.

02:019:019 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed
           louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a
           voice.

02:019:020 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the
           mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount;
           and Moses went up.

02:019:021 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest
           they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them
           perish.

02:019:022 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD,
           sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them.

02:019:023 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to
           mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about
           the mount, and sanctify it.

02:019:024 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou
           shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the
           priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD,
           lest he break forth upon them.

02:019:025 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them.

02:020:001 And God spake all these words, saying,

02:020:002 I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land
           of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

02:020:003 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.

02:020:004 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any
           likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in
           the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth.

02:020:005 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I
           the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
           the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
           generation of them that hate me;

02:020:006 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and
           keep my commandments.

02:020:007 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for
           the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
           vain.

02:020:008 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

02:020:009 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:

02:020:010 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
           thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
           daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle,
           nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:

02:020:011 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
           all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the
           LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.

02:020:012 Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long
           upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

02:020:013 Thou shalt not kill.

02:020:014 Thou shalt not commit adultery.

02:020:015 Thou shalt not steal.

02:020:016 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.

02:020:017 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not
           covet thy neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his
           maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is
           thy neighbour's.

02:020:018 And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings,
           and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and
           when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off.

02:020:019 And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will
           hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.

02:020:020 And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to
           prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye
           sin not.

02:020:021 And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the
           thick darkness where God was.

02:020:022 And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the
           children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you
           from heaven.

02:020:023 Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye
           make unto you gods of gold.

02:020:024 An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
           thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy
           sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I
           will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.

02:020:025 And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not
           build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it,
           thou hast polluted it.

02:020:026 Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy
           nakedness be not discovered thereon.

02:021:001 Now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.

02:021:002 If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and
           in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.

02:021:003 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he
           were married, then his wife shall go out with him.

02:021:004 If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him
           sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her
           master's, and he shall go out by himself.

02:021:005 And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my
           wife, and my children; I will not go out free:

02:021:006 Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also
           bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master
           shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him
           for ever.

02:021:007 And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall
           not go out as the menservants do.

02:021:008 If she please not her master, who hath betrothed her to
           himself, then shall he let her be redeemed: to sell her unto a
           strange nation he shall have no power, seeing he hath dealt
           deceitfully with her.

02:021:009 And if he have betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with
           her after the manner of daughters.

02:021:010 If he take him another wife; her food, her raiment, and her
           duty of marriage, shall he not diminish.

02:021:011 And if he do not these three unto her, then shall she go out
           free without money.

02:021:012 He that smiteth a man, so that he die, shall be surely put to
           death.

02:021:013 And if a man lie not in wait, but God deliver him into his
           hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.

02:021:014 But if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour, to slay
           him with guile; thou shalt take him from mine altar, that he
           may die.

02:021:015 And he that smiteth his father, or his mother, shall be surely
           put to death.

02:021:016 And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, or if he be found
           in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

02:021:017 And he that curseth his father, or his mother, shall surely be
           put to death.

02:021:018 And if men strive together, and one smite another with a
           stone, or with his fist, and he die not, but keepeth his bed:

02:021:019 If he rise again, and walk abroad upon his staff, then shall
           he that smote him be quit: only he shall pay for the loss of
           his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.

02:021:020 And if a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and
           he die under his hand; he shall be surely punished.

02:021:021 Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be
           punished: for he is his money.

02:021:022 If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit
           depart from her, and yet no mischief follow: he shall be
           surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay
           upon him; and he shall pay as the judges determine.

02:021:023 And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give life for
           life,

02:021:024 Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

02:021:025 Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.

02:021:026 And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his
           maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's
           sake.

02:021:027 And if he smite out his manservant's tooth, or his
           maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth's
           sake.

02:021:028 If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox
           shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but
           the owner of the ox shall be quit.

02:021:029 But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past,
           and it hath been testified to his owner, and he hath not kept
           him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall
           be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.

02:021:030 If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for
           the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him.

02:021:031 Whether he have gored a son, or have gored a daughter,
           according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.

02:021:032 If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall
           give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox
           shall be stoned.

02:021:033 And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit,
           and not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall therein;

02:021:034 The owner of the pit shall make it good, and give money unto
           the owner of them; and the dead beast shall be his.

02:021:035 And if one man's ox hurt another's, that he die; then they
           shall sell the live ox, and divide the money of it; and the
           dead ox also they shall divide.

02:021:036 Or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past,
           and his owner hath not kept him in; he shall surely pay ox for
           ox; and the dead shall be his own.

02:022:001 If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell
           it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a
           sheep.

02:022:002 If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die,
           there shall no blood be shed for him.

02:022:003 If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for
           him; for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing,
           then he shall be sold for his theft.

02:022:004 If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it
           be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.

02:022:005 If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and
           shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man's field;
           of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own
           vineyard, shall he make restitution.

02:022:006 If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of
           corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed
           therewith; he that kindled the fire shall surely make
           restitution.

02:022:007 If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to
           keep, and it be stolen out of the man's house; if the thief be
           found, let him pay double.

02:022:008 If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall
           be brought unto the judges, to see whether he have put his
           hand unto his neighbour's goods.

02:022:009 For all manner of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for
           sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing which
           another challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall
           come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he
           shall pay double unto his neighbour.

02:022:010 If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a
           sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or
           driven away, no man seeing it:

02:022:011 Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he
           hath not put his hand unto his neighbour's goods; and the
           owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it
           good.

02:022:012 And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto
           the owner thereof.

02:022:013 If it be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness,
           and he shall not make good that which was torn.

02:022:014 And if a man borrow ought of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or
           die, the owner thereof being not with it, he shall surely make
           it good.

02:022:015 But if the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it
           good: if it be an hired thing, it came for his hire.

02:022:016 And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with
           her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.

02:022:017 If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall
           pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

02:022:018 Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

02:022:019 Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.

02:022:020 He that sacrificeth unto any god, save unto the LORD only, he
           shall be utterly destroyed.

02:022:021 Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye
           were strangers in the land of Egypt.

02:022:022 Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.

02:022:023 If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me,
           I will surely hear their cry;

02:022:024 And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the
           sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children
           fatherless.

02:022:025 If thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee,
           thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay
           upon him usury.

02:022:026 If thou at all take thy neighbour's raiment to pledge, thou
           shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:

02:022:027 For that is his covering only, it is his raiment for his skin:
           wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he
           crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.

02:022:028 Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy
           people.

02:022:029 Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits,
           and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give
           unto me.

02:022:030 Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep:
           seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou
           shalt give it me.

02:022:031 And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat any
           flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to
           the dogs.

02:023:001 Thou shalt not raise a false report: put not thine hand with
           the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.

02:023:002 Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt
           thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:

02:023:003 Neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause.

02:023:004 If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou
           shalt surely bring it back to him again.

02:023:005 If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his
           burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely
           help with him.

02:023:006 Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause.

02:023:007 Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and
           righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.

02:023:008 And thou shalt take no gift: for the gift blindeth the wise,
           and perverteth the words of the righteous.

02:023:009 Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart
           of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.

02:023:010 And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the
           fruits thereof:

02:023:011 But the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still;
           that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the
           beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal
           with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.

02:023:012 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou
           shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son
           of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.

02:023:013 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect:
           and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it
           be heard out of thy mouth.

02:023:014 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.

02:023:015 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat
           unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time
           appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from
           Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)

02:023:016 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours,
           which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of
           ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast
           gathered in thy labours out of the field.

02:023:017 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the
           LORD God.

02:023:018 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened
           bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the
           morning.

02:023:019 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into
           the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
           his mother's milk.

02:023:020 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way,
           and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.

02:023:021 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he
           will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.

02:023:022 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I
           speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an
           adversary unto thine adversaries.

02:023:023 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto
           the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the
           Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut
           them off.

02:023:024 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do
           after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and
           quite break down their images.

02:023:025 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy
           bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the
           midst of thee.

02:023:026 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy
           land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.

02:023:027 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the
           people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine
           enemies turn their backs unto thee.

02:023:028 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the
           Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.

02:023:029 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest
           the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply
           against thee.

02:023:030 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee,
           until thou be increased, and inherit the land.

02:023:031 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea
           of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I
           will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and
           thou shalt drive them out before thee.

02:023:032 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

02:023:033 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin
           against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a
           snare unto thee.

02:024:001 And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the LORD, thou, and
           Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel;
           and worship ye afar off.

02:024:002 And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not
           come nigh; neither shall the people go up with him.

02:024:003 And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD,
           and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one
           voice, and said, All the words which the LORD hath said will
           we do.

02:024:004 And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early
           in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and
           twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.

02:024:005 And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered
           burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto
           the LORD.

02:024:006 And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basons; and
           half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

02:024:007 And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience
           of the people: and they said, All that the LORD hath said will
           we do, and be obedient.

02:024:008 And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and
           said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD hath
           made with you concerning all these words.

02:024:009 Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy
           of the elders of Israel:

02:024:010 And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet
           as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were
           the body of heaven in his clearness.

02:024:011 And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his
           hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.

02:024:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Come up to me into the mount,
           and be there: and I will give thee tables of stone, and a law,
           and commandments which I have written; that thou mayest teach
           them.

02:024:013 And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up
           into the mount of God.

02:024:014 And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we
           come again unto you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you:
           if any man have any matters to do, let him come unto them.

02:024:015 And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the
           mount.

02:024:016 And the glory of the LORD abode upon mount Sinai, and the
           cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto
           Moses out of the midst of the cloud.

02:024:017 And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire
           on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.

02:024:018 And Moses went into the midst of the cloud, and gat him up
           into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and
           forty nights.

02:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an
           offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart
           ye shall take my offering.

02:025:003 And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold,
           and silver, and brass,

02:025:004 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
           hair,

02:025:005 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
           wood,

02:025:006 Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet
           incense,

02:025:007 Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the
           breastplate.

02:025:008 And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.

02:025:009 According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the
           tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof,
           even so shall ye make it.

02:025:010 And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
           half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
           breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.

02:025:011 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without
           shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold
           round about.

02:025:012 And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in
           the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one
           side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.

02:025:013 And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them
           with gold.

02:025:014 And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of
           the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.

02:025:015 The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be
           taken from it.

02:025:016 And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall
           give thee.

02:025:017 And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and
           a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the
           breadth thereof.

02:025:018 And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work
           shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.

02:025:019 And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on
           the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the
           cherubims on the two ends thereof.

02:025:020 And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high,
           covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces
           shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the
           faces of the cherubims be.

02:025:021 And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in
           the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.

02:025:022 And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee
           from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims
           which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I
           will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.

02:025:023 Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall
           be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a
           cubit and a half the height thereof.

02:025:024 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a
           crown of gold round about.

02:025:025 And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round
           about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border
           thereof round about.

02:025:026 And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the
           rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

02:025:027 Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the
           staves to bear the table.

02:025:028 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
           them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.

02:025:029 And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof,
           and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of
           pure gold shalt thou make them.

02:025:030 And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.

02:025:031 And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work
           shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches,
           his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.

02:025:032 And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three
           branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three
           branches of the candlestick out of the other side:

02:025:033 Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower
           in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other
           branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that
           come out of the candlestick.

02:025:034 And in the candlesticks shall be four bowls made like unto
           almonds, with their knops and their flowers.

02:025:035 And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and
           a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two
           branches of the same, according to the six branches that
           proceed out of the candlestick.

02:025:036 Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it
           shall be one beaten work of pure gold.

02:025:037 And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall
           light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against
           it.

02:025:038 And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be
           of pure gold.

02:025:039 Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these
           vessels.

02:025:040 And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was
           shewed thee in the mount.

02:026:001 Moreover thou shalt make the tabernacle with ten curtains of
           fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: with
           cherubims of cunning work shalt thou make them.

02:026:002 The length of one curtain shall be eight and twenty cubits,
           and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: and every one of
           the curtains shall have one measure.

02:026:003 The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another;
           and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.

02:026:004 And thou shalt make loops of blue upon the edge of the one
           curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shalt
           thou make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the
           coupling of the second.

02:026:005 Fifty loops shalt thou make in the one curtain, and fifty
           loops shalt thou make in the edge of the curtain that is in
           the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one
           of another.

02:026:006 And thou shalt make fifty taches of gold, and couple the
           curtains together with the taches: and it shall be one
           tabernacle.

02:026:007 And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering
           upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make.

02:026:008 The length of one curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the
           breadth of one curtain four cubits: and the eleven curtains
           shall be all of one measure.

02:026:009 And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six
           curtains by themselves, and shalt double the sixth curtain in
           the forefront of the tabernacle.

02:026:010 And thou shalt make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain
           that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops in the edge
           of the curtain which coupleth the second.

02:026:011 And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches
           into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be
           one.

02:026:012 And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent,
           the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside
           of the tabernacle.

02:026:013 And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of
           that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the
           tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this
           side and on that side, to cover it.

02:026:014 And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins
           dyed red, and a covering above of badgers' skins.

02:026:015 And thou shalt make boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood
           standing up.

02:026:016 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and a cubit and a
           half shall be the breadth of one board.

02:026:017 Two tenons shall there be in one board, set in order one
           against another: thus shalt thou make for all the boards of
           the tabernacle.

02:026:018 And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty
           boards on the south side southward.

02:026:019 And thou shalt make forty sockets of silver under the twenty
           boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and
           two sockets under another board for his two tenons.

02:026:020 And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side
           there shall be twenty boards:

02:026:021 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
           board, and two sockets under another board.

02:026:022 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward thou shalt make
           six boards.

02:026:023 And two boards shalt thou make for the corners of the
           tabernacle in the two sides.

02:026:024 And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be
           coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus
           shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

02:026:025 And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver,
           sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets
           under another board.

02:026:026 And thou shalt make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards
           of the one side of the tabernacle,

02:026:027 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
           tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the
           tabernacle, for the two sides westward.

02:026:028 And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from
           end to end.

02:026:029 And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their
           rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay
           the bars with gold.

02:026:030 And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion
           thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.

02:026:031 And thou shalt make a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubims shall it
           be made:

02:026:032 And thou shalt hang it upon four pillars of shittim wood
           overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, upon the
           four sockets of silver.

02:026:033 And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou
           mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the
           testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy
           place and the most holy.

02:026:034 And thou shalt put the mercy seat upon the ark of the
           testimony in the most holy place.

02:026:035 And thou shalt set the table without the vail, and the
           candlestick over against the table on the side of the
           tabernacle toward the south: and thou shalt put the table on
           the north side.

02:026:036 And thou shalt make an hanging for the door of the tent, of
           blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, wrought
           with needlework.

02:026:037 And thou shalt make for the hanging five pillars of shittim
           wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of
           gold: and thou shalt cast five sockets of brass for them.

02:027:001 And thou shalt make an altar of shittim wood, five cubits
           long, and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare:
           and the height thereof shall be three cubits.

02:027:002 And thou shalt make the horns of it upon the four corners
           thereof: his horns shall be of the same: and thou shalt
           overlay it with brass.

02:027:003 And thou shalt make his pans to receive his ashes, and his
           shovels, and his basons, and his fleshhooks, and his firepans:
           all the vessels thereof thou shalt make of brass.

02:027:004 And thou shalt make for it a grate of network of brass; and
           upon the net shalt thou make four brasen rings in the four
           corners thereof.

02:027:005 And thou shalt put it under the compass of the altar beneath,
           that the net may be even to the midst of the altar.

02:027:006 And thou shalt make staves for the altar, staves of shittim
           wood, and overlay them with brass.

02:027:007 And the staves shall be put into the rings, and the staves
           shall be upon the two sides of the altar, to bear it.

02:027:008 Hollow with boards shalt thou make it: as it was shewed thee
           in the mount, so shall they make it.

02:027:009 And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle: for the south
           side southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine
           twined linen of an hundred cubits long for one side:

02:027:010 And the twenty pillars thereof and their twenty sockets shall
           be of brass; the hooks of the pillars and their fillets shall
           be of silver.

02:027:011 And likewise for the north side in length there shall be
           hangings of an hundred cubits long, and his twenty pillars and
           their twenty sockets of brass; the hooks of the pillars and
           their fillets of silver.

02:027:012 And for the breadth of the court on the west side shall be
           hangings of fifty cubits: their pillars ten, and their sockets
           ten.

02:027:013 And the breadth of the court on the east side eastward shall
           be fifty cubits.

02:027:014 The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits:
           their pillars three, and their sockets three.

02:027:015 And on the other side shall be hangings fifteen cubits: their
           pillars three, and their sockets three.

02:027:016 And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty
           cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined
           linen, wrought with needlework: and their pillars shall be
           four, and their sockets four.

02:027:017 All the pillars round about the court shall be filleted with
           silver; their hooks shall be of silver, and their sockets of
           brass.

02:027:018 The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the
           breadth fifty every where, and the height five cubits of fine
           twined linen, and their sockets of brass.

02:027:019 All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof,
           and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall
           be of brass.

02:027:020 And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring
           thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to
           burn always.

02:027:021 In the tabernacle of the congregation without the vail, which
           is before the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall order it
           from evening to morning before the LORD: it shall be a statute
           for ever unto their generations on the behalf of the children
           of Israel.

02:028:001 And take thou unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with
           him, from among the children of Israel, that he may minister
           unto me in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu,
           Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.

02:028:002 And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother for
           glory and for beauty.

02:028:003 And thou shalt speak unto all that are wise hearted, whom I
           have filled with the spirit of wisdom, that they may make
           Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that he may minister unto
           me in the priest's office.

02:028:004 And these are the garments which they shall make; a
           breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe, and a broidered coat, a
           mitre, and a girdle: and they shall make holy garments for
           Aaron thy brother, and his sons, that he may minister unto me
           in the priest's office.

02:028:005 And they shall take gold, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine linen.

02:028:006 And they shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and of purple,
           of scarlet, and fine twined linen, with cunning work.

02:028:007 It shall have the two shoulderpieces thereof joined at the two
           edges thereof; and so it shall be joined together.

02:028:008 And the curious girdle of the ephod, which is upon it, shall
           be of the same, according to the work thereof; even of gold,
           of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

02:028:009 And thou shalt take two onyx stones, and grave on them the
           names of the children of Israel:

02:028:010 Six of their names on one stone, and the other six names of
           the rest on the other stone, according to their birth.

02:028:011 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings of
           a signet, shalt thou engrave the two stones with the names of
           the children of Israel: thou shalt make them to be set in
           ouches of gold.

02:028:012 And thou shalt put the two stones upon the shoulders of the
           ephod for stones of memorial unto the children of Israel: and
           Aaron shall bear their names before the LORD upon his two
           shoulders for a memorial.

02:028:013 And thou shalt make ouches of gold;

02:028:014 And two chains of pure gold at the ends; of wreathen work
           shalt thou make them, and fasten the wreathen chains to the
           ouches.

02:028:015 And thou shalt make the breastplate of judgment with cunning
           work; after the work of the ephod thou shalt make it; of gold,
           of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine twined
           linen, shalt thou make it.

02:028:016 Foursquare it shall be being doubled; a span shall be the
           length thereof, and a span shall be the breadth thereof.

02:028:017 And thou shalt set in it settings of stones, even four rows of
           stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a
           carbuncle: this shall be the first row.

02:028:018 And the second row shall be an emerald, a sapphire, and a
           diamond.

02:028:019 And the third row a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

02:028:020 And the fourth row a beryl, and an onyx, and a jasper: they
           shall be set in gold in their inclosings.

02:028:021 And the stones shall be with the names of the children of
           Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
           of a signet; every one with his name shall they be according
           to the twelve tribes.

02:028:022 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate chains at the ends of
           wreathen work of pure gold.

02:028:023 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold,
           and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the
           breastplate.

02:028:024 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two
           rings which are on the ends of the breastplate.

02:028:025 And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt
           fasten in the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces
           of the ephod before it.

02:028:026 And thou shalt make two rings of gold, and thou shalt put them
           upon the two ends of the breastplate in the border thereof,
           which is in the side of the ephod inward.

02:028:027 And two other rings of gold thou shalt make, and shalt put
           them on the two sides of the ephod underneath, toward the
           forepart thereof, over against the other coupling thereof,
           above the curious girdle of the ephod.

02:028:028 And they shall bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto
           the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be
           above the curious girdle of the ephod, and that the
           breastplate be not loosed from the ephod.

02:028:029 And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in
           the breastplate of judgment upon his heart, when he goeth in
           unto the holy place, for a memorial before the LORD
           continually.

02:028:030 And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and
           the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he
           goeth in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of
           the children of Israel upon his heart before the LORD
           continually.

02:028:031 And thou shalt make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

02:028:032 And there shall be an hole in the top of it, in the midst
           thereof: it shall have a binding of woven work round about the
           hole of it, as it were the hole of an habergeon, that it be
           not rent.

02:028:033 And beneath upon the hem of it thou shalt make pomegranates of
           blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, round about the hem
           thereof; and bells of gold between them round about:

02:028:034 A golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a
           pomegranate, upon the hem of the robe round about.

02:028:035 And it shall be upon Aaron to minister: and his sound shall be
           heard when he goeth in unto the holy place before the LORD,
           and when he cometh out, that he die not.

02:028:036 And thou shalt make a plate of pure gold, and grave upon it,
           like the engravings of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

02:028:037 And thou shalt put it on a blue lace, that it may be upon the
           mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be.

02:028:038 And it shall be upon Aaron's forehead, that Aaron may bear the
           iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel
           shall hallow in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always
           upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the LORD.

02:028:039 And thou shalt embroider the coat of fine linen, and thou
           shalt make the mitre of fine linen, and thou shalt make the
           girdle of needlework.

02:028:040 And for Aaron's sons thou shalt make coats, and thou shalt
           make for them girdles, and bonnets shalt thou make for them,
           for glory and for beauty.

02:028:041 And thou shalt put them upon Aaron thy brother, and his sons
           with him; and shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and
           sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's
           office.

02:028:042 And thou shalt make them linen breeches to cover their
           nakedness; from the loins even unto the thighs they shall
           reach:

02:028:043 And they shall be upon Aaron, and upon his sons, when they
           come in unto the tabernacle of the congregation, or when they
           come near unto the altar to minister in the holy place; that
           they bear not iniquity, and die: it shall be a statute for
           ever unto him and his seed after him.

02:029:001 And this is the thing that thou shalt do unto them to hallow
           them, to minister unto me in the priest's office: Take one
           young bullock, and two rams without blemish,

02:029:002 And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil,
           and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour
           shalt thou make them.

02:029:003 And thou shalt put them into one basket, and bring them in the
           basket, with the bullock and the two rams.

02:029:004 And Aaron and his sons thou shalt bring unto the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, and shalt wash them with
           water.

02:029:005 And thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the coat,
           and the robe of the ephod, and the ephod, and the breastplate,
           and gird him with the curious girdle of the ephod:

02:029:006 And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and put the holy
           crown upon the mitre.

02:029:007 Then shalt thou take the anointing oil, and pour it upon his
           head, and anoint him.

02:029:008 And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them.

02:029:009 And thou shalt gird them with girdles, Aaron and his sons, and
           put the bonnets on them: and the priest's office shall be
           theirs for a perpetual statute: and thou shalt consecrate
           Aaron and his sons.

02:029:010 And thou shalt cause a bullock to be brought before the
           tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron and his sons shall
           put their hands upon the head of the bullock.

02:029:011 And thou shalt kill the bullock before the LORD, by the door
           of the tabernacle of the congregation.

02:029:012 And thou shalt take of the blood of the bullock, and put it
           upon the horns of the altar with thy finger, and pour all the
           blood beside the bottom of the altar.

02:029:013 And thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and
           the caul that is above the liver, and the two kidneys, and the
           fat that is upon them, and burn them upon the altar.

02:029:014 But the flesh of the bullock, and his skin, and his dung,
           shalt thou burn with fire without the camp: it is a sin
           offering.

02:029:015 Thou shalt also take one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall put
           their hands upon the head of the ram.

02:029:016 And thou shalt slay the ram, and thou shalt take his blood,
           and sprinkle it round about upon the altar.

02:029:017 And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of
           him, and his legs, and put them unto his pieces, and unto his
           head.

02:029:018 And thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the altar: it is a
           burnt offering unto the LORD: it is a sweet savour, an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD.

02:029:019 And thou shalt take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons
           shall put their hands upon the head of the ram.

02:029:020 Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put
           it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and upon the tip of
           the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right
           hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and sprinkle
           the blood upon the altar round about.

02:029:021 And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and
           of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his
           garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons
           with him: and he shall be hallowed, and his garments, and his
           sons, and his sons' garments with him.

02:029:022 Also thou shalt take of the ram the fat and the rump, and the
           fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul above the liver,
           and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the
           right shoulder; for it is a ram of consecration:

02:029:023 And one loaf of bread, and one cake of oiled bread, and one
           wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before
           the LORD:

02:029:024 And thou shalt put all in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands
           of his sons; and shalt wave them for a wave offering before
           the LORD.

02:029:025 And thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon
           the altar for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour before the
           LORD: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

02:029:026 And thou shalt take the breast of the ram of Aaron's
           consecration, and wave it for a wave offering before the LORD:
           and it shall be thy part.

02:029:027 And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and
           the shoulder of the heave offering, which is waved, and which
           is heaved up, of the ram of the consecration, even of that
           which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons:

02:029:028 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons' by a statute for ever
           from the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering: and
           it shall be an heave offering from the children of Israel of
           the sacrifice of their peace offerings, even their heave
           offering unto the LORD.

02:029:029 And the holy garments of Aaron shall be his sons' after him,
           to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated in them.

02:029:030 And that son that is priest in his stead shall put them on
           seven days, when he cometh into the tabernacle of the
           congregation to minister in the holy place.

02:029:031 And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe
           his flesh in the holy place.

02:029:032 And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the
           bread that is in the basket by the door of the tabernacle of
           the congregation.

02:029:033 And they shall eat those things wherewith the atonement was
           made, to consecrate and to sanctify them: but a stranger shall
           not eat thereof, because they are holy.

02:029:034 And if ought of the flesh of the consecrations, or of the
           bread, remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the
           remainder with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is
           holy.

02:029:035 And thus shalt thou do unto Aaron, and to his sons, according
           to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt
           thou consecrate them.

02:029:036 And thou shalt offer every day a bullock for a sin offering
           for atonement: and thou shalt cleanse the altar, when thou
           hast made an atonement for it, and thou shalt anoint it, to
           sanctify it.

02:029:037 Seven days thou shalt make an atonement for the altar, and
           sanctify it; and it shall be an altar most holy: whatsoever
           toucheth the altar shall be holy.

02:029:038 Now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar; two
           lambs of the first year day by day continually.

02:029:039 The one lamb thou shalt offer in the morning; and the other
           lamb thou shalt offer at even:

02:029:040 And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the
           fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an
           hin of wine for a drink offering.

02:029:041 And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, and shalt do
           thereto according to the meat offering of the morning, and
           according to the drink offering thereof, for a sweet savour,
           an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

02:029:042 This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your
           generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation
           before the LORD: where I will meet you, to speak there unto
           thee.

02:029:043 And there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the
           tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory.

02:029:044 And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation, and
           the altar: I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons, to
           minister to me in the priest's office.

02:029:045 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be
           their God.

02:029:046 And they shall know that I am the LORD their God, that brought
           them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among
           them: I am the LORD their God.

02:030:001 And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of shittim
           wood shalt thou make it.

02:030:002 A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth
           thereof; foursquare shall it be: and two cubits shall be the
           height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of the same.

02:030:003 And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and
           the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou
           shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.

02:030:004 And two golden rings shalt thou make to it under the crown of
           it, by the two corners thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt
           thou make it; and they shall be for places for the staves to
           bear it withal.

02:030:005 And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay
           them with gold.

02:030:006 And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of
           the testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the
           testimony, where I will meet with thee.

02:030:007 And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when
           he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.

02:030:008 And when Aaron lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn
           incense upon it, a perpetual incense before the LORD
           throughout your generations.

02:030:009 Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt
           sacrifice, nor meat offering; neither shall ye pour drink
           offering thereon.

02:030:010 And Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in
           a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements: once
           in the year shall he make atonement upon it throughout your
           generations: it is most holy unto the LORD.

02:030:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:030:012 When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their
           number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul
           unto the LORD, when thou numberest them; that there be no
           plague among them, when thou numberest them.

02:030:013 This they shall give, every one that passeth among them that
           are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary:
           (a shekel is twenty gerahs:) an half shekel shall be the
           offering of the LORD.

02:030:014 Every one that passeth among them that are numbered, from
           twenty years old and above, shall give an offering unto the
           LORD.

02:030:015 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less
           than half a shekel, when they give an offering unto the LORD,
           to make an atonement for your souls.

02:030:016 And thou shalt take the atonement money of the children of
           Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tabernacle
           of the congregation; that it may be a memorial unto the
           children of Israel before the LORD, to make an atonement for
           your souls.

02:030:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:030:018 Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and his foot also of
           brass, to wash withal: and thou shalt put it between the
           tabernacle of the congregation and the altar, and thou shalt
           put water therein.

02:030:019 For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet
           thereat:

02:030:020 When they go into the tabernacle of the congregation, they
           shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come
           near to the altar to minister, to burn offering made by fire
           unto the LORD:

02:030:021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die
           not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him
           and to his seed throughout their generations.

02:030:022 Moreover the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:030:023 Take thou also unto thee principal spices, of pure myrrh five
           hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two
           hundred and fifty shekels, and of sweet calamus two hundred
           and fifty shekels,

02:030:024 And of cassia five hundred shekels, after the shekel of the
           sanctuary, and of oil olive an hin:

02:030:025 And thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment
           compound after the art of the apothecary: it shall be an holy
           anointing oil.

02:030:026 And thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation
           therewith, and the ark of the testimony,

02:030:027 And the table and all his vessels, and the candlestick and his
           vessels, and the altar of incense,

02:030:028 And the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels, and the
           laver and his foot.

02:030:029 And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy:
           whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.

02:030:030 And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them,
           that they may minister unto me in the priest's office.

02:030:031 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This
           shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your
           generations.

02:030:032 Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make
           any other like it, after the composition of it: it is holy,
           and it shall be holy unto you.

02:030:033 Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of
           it upon a stranger, shall even be cut off from his people.

02:030:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take unto thee sweet spices,
           stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; these sweet spices with pure
           frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight:

02:030:035 And thou shalt make it a perfume, a confection after the art
           of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:

02:030:036 And thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it
           before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation,
           where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.

02:030:037 And as for the perfume which thou shalt make, ye shall not
           make to yourselves according to the composition thereof: it
           shall be unto thee holy for the LORD.

02:030:038 Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereto, shall
           even be cut off from his people.

02:031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:031:002 See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of
           Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

02:031:003 And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and
           in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
           workmanship,

02:031:004 To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and
           in brass,

02:031:005 And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
           timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.

02:031:006 And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of
           Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that
           are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all
           that I have commanded thee;

02:031:007 The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the
           testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the
           furniture of the tabernacle,

02:031:008 And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with
           all his furniture, and the altar of incense,

02:031:009 And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and
           the laver and his foot,

02:031:010 And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the
           priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the
           priest's office,

02:031:011 And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place:
           according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.

02:031:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:031:013 Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my
           sabbaths ye shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you
           throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the
           LORD that doth sanctify you.

02:031:014 Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you:
           every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death: for
           whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off
           from among his people.

02:031:015 Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath
           of rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the
           sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.

02:031:016 Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to
           observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a
           perpetual covenant.

02:031:017 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever:
           for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the
           seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.

02:031:018 And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing
           with him upon mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of
           stone, written with the finger of God.

02:032:001 And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of
           the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron,
           and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us;
           for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
           land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

02:032:002 And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which
           are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your
           daughters, and bring them unto me.

02:032:003 And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in
           their ears, and brought them unto Aaron.

02:032:004 And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a
           graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they
           said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out
           of the land of Egypt.

02:032:005 And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron
           made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.

02:032:006 And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt
           offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat
           down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.

02:032:007 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy
           people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have
           corrupted themselves:

02:032:008 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I
           commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have
           worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These
           be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the
           land of Egypt.

02:032:009 And the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and,
           behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

02:032:010 Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against
           them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a
           great nation.

02:032:011 And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth
           thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought
           forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a
           mighty hand?

02:032:012 Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief
           did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to
           consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce
           wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people.

02:032:013 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy servants, to whom
           thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will
           multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land
           that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they
           shall inherit it for ever.

02:032:014 And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto
           his people.

02:032:015 And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two
           tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were
           written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other
           were they written.

02:032:016 And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the
           writing of God, graven upon the tables.

02:032:017 And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,
           he said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.

02:032:018 And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for
           mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being
           overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.

02:032:019 And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp,
           that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed
           hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them
           beneath the mount.

02:032:020 And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the
           fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water,
           and made the children of Israel drink of it.

02:032:021 And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee,
           that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?

02:032:022 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou
           knowest the people, that they are set on mischief.

02:032:023 For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us:
           for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the
           land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.

02:032:024 And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break
           it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and
           there came out this calf.

02:032:025 And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had
           made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:)

02:032:026 Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on
           the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of
           Levi gathered themselves together unto him.

02:032:027 And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put
           every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate
           to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother,
           and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour.

02:032:028 And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses:
           and there fell of the people that day about three thousand
           men.

02:032:029 For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD,
           even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may
           bestow upon you a blessing this day.

02:032:030 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said unto the
           people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto
           the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.

02:032:031 And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people
           have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.

02:032:032 Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot
           me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.

02:032:033 And the LORD said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against
           me, him will I blot out of my book.

02:032:034 Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I
           have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before
           thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their
           sin upon them.

02:032:035 And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf,
           which Aaron made.

02:033:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Depart, and go up hence, thou
           and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of
           Egypt, unto the land which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and
           to Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it:

02:033:002 And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the
           Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite,
           the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

02:033:003 Unto a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up
           in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people: lest
           I consume thee in the way.

02:033:004 And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned:
           and no man did put on him his ornaments.

02:033:005 For the LORD had said unto Moses, Say unto the children of
           Israel, Ye are a stiffnecked people: I will come up into the
           midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put
           off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do unto
           thee.

02:033:006 And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their
           ornaments by the mount Horeb.

02:033:007 And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the
           camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of
           the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which
           sought the LORD went out unto the tabernacle of the
           congregation, which was without the camp.

02:033:008 And it came to pass, when Moses went out unto the tabernacle,
           that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent
           door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the
           tabernacle.

02:033:009 And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the
           cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the
           tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.

02:033:010 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the
           tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped,
           every man in his tent door.

02:033:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh
           unto his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his
           servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out
           of the tabernacle.

02:033:012 And Moses said unto the LORD, See, thou sayest unto me, Bring
           up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt
           send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and
           thou hast also found grace in my sight.

02:033:013 Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy
           sight, shew me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may
           find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy
           people.

02:033:014 And he said, My presence shall go with thee, and I will give
           thee rest.

02:033:015 And he said unto him, If thy presence go not with me, carry us
           not up hence.

02:033:016 For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have
           found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with
           us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the
           people that are upon the face of the earth.

02:033:017 And the LORD said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that
           thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I
           know thee by name.

02:033:018 And he said, I beseech thee, shew me thy glory.

02:033:019 And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and
           I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be
           gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on
           whom I will shew mercy.

02:033:020 And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no
           man see me, and live.

02:033:021 And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
           shalt stand upon a rock:

02:033:022 And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I
           will put thee in a clift of the rock, and will cover thee with
           my hand while I pass by:

02:033:023 And I will take away mine hand, and thou shalt see my back
           parts: but my face shall not be seen.

02:034:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone
           like unto the first: and I will write upon these tables the
           words that were in the first tables, which thou brakest.

02:034:002 And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning unto
           mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me in the top of the
           mount.

02:034:003 And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be
           seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor
           herds feed before that mount.

02:034:004 And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and
           Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount
           Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the
           two tables of stone.

02:034:005 And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,
           and proclaimed the name of the LORD.

02:034:006 And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD,
           The LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and
           abundant in goodness and truth,

02:034:007 Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and
           transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the
           guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the
           children, and upon the children's children, unto the third and
           to the fourth generation.

02:034:008 And Moses made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and
           worshipped.

02:034:009 And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O LORD,
           let my LORD, I pray thee, go among us; for it is a stiffnecked
           people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for
           thine inheritance.

02:034:010 And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people
           I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the
           earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou
           art shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing
           that I will do with thee.

02:034:011 Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I
           drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the
           Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

02:034:012 Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the
           inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a
           snare in the midst of thee:

02:034:013 But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut
           down their groves:

02:034:014 For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name
           is Jealous, is a jealous God:

02:034:015 Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,
           and they go a whoring after their gods, and do sacrifice unto
           their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice;

02:034:016 And thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their
           daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go
           a whoring after their gods.

02:034:017 Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

02:034:018 The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou
           shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time
           of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from
           Egypt.

02:034:019 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among
           thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male.

02:034:020 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and
           if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All
           the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall
           appear before me empty.

02:034:021 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt
           rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.

02:034:022 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits
           of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year's
           end.

02:034:023 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before
           the LORD God, the God of Israel.

02:034:024 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy
           borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou
           shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the
           year.

02:034:025 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven;
           neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be
           left unto the morning.

02:034:026 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto
           the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in
           his mother's milk.

02:034:027 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for
           after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with
           thee and with Israel.

02:034:028 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he
           did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the
           tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

02:034:029 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai
           with the two tables of testimony in Moses' hand, when he came
           down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his
           face shone while he talked with him.

02:034:030 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses,
           behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to
           come nigh him.

02:034:031 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of
           the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with
           them.

02:034:032 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he
           gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him
           in mount Sinai.

02:034:033 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on
           his face.

02:034:034 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he
           took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and
           spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

02:034:035 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the
           skin of Moses' face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his
           face again, until he went in to speak with him.

02:035:001 And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of
           Israel together, and said unto them, These are the words which
           the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them.

02:035:002 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there
           shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD:
           whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death.

02:035:003 Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the
           sabbath day.

02:035:004 And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of
           Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded,
           saying,

02:035:005 Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is
           of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD;
           gold, and silver, and brass,

02:035:006 And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats'
           hair,

02:035:007 And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim
           wood,

02:035:008 And oil for the light, and spices for anointing oil, and for
           the sweet incense,

02:035:009 And onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for
           the breastplate.

02:035:010 And every wise hearted among you shall come, and make all that
           the LORD hath commanded;

02:035:011 The tabernacle, his tent, and his covering, his taches, and
           his boards, his bars, his pillars, and his sockets,

02:035:012 The ark, and the staves thereof, with the mercy seat, and the
           vail of the covering,

02:035:013 The table, and his staves, and all his vessels, and the
           shewbread,

02:035:014 The candlestick also for the light, and his furniture, and his
           lamps, with the oil for the light,

02:035:015 And the incense altar, and his staves, and the anointing oil,
           and the sweet incense, and the hanging for the door at the
           entering in of the tabernacle,

02:035:016 The altar of burnt offering, with his brasen grate, his
           staves, and all his vessels, the laver and his foot,

02:035:017 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and their sockets, and
           the hanging for the door of the court,

02:035:018 The pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and
           their cords,

02:035:019 The cloths of service, to do service in the holy place, the
           holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his
           sons, to minister in the priest's office.

02:035:020 And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed
           from the presence of Moses.

02:035:021 And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every
           one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD's
           offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation,
           and for all his service, and for the holy garments.

02:035:022 And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing
           hearted, and brought bracelets, and earrings, and rings, and
           tablets, all jewels of gold: and every man that offered
           offered an offering of gold unto the LORD.

02:035:023 And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and
           scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of
           rams, and badgers' skins, brought them.

02:035:024 Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass
           brought the LORD's offering: and every man, with whom was
           found shittim wood for any work of the service, brought it.

02:035:025 And all the women that were wise hearted did spin with their
           hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and
           of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen.

02:035:026 And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun
           goats' hair.

02:035:027 And the rulers brought onyx stones, and stones to be set, for
           the ephod, and for the breastplate;

02:035:028 And spice, and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil,
           and for the sweet incense.

02:035:029 The children of Israel brought a willing offering unto the
           LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to
           bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to
           be made by the hand of Moses.

02:035:030 And Moses said unto the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath
           called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the
           tribe of Judah;

02:035:031 And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in
           understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of
           workmanship;

02:035:032 And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver,
           and in brass,

02:035:033 And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of
           wood, to make any manner of cunning work.

02:035:034 And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and
           Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

02:035:035 Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner
           of work, of the engraver, and of the cunning workman, and of
           the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in
           fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work,
           and of those that devise cunning work.

02:036:001 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man,
           in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to
           work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary,
           according to all that the LORD had commanded.

02:036:002 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
           man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one
           whose heart stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:

02:036:003 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the
           children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of
           the sanctuary, to make it withal. And they brought yet unto
           him free offerings every morning.

02:036:004 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the
           sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;

02:036:005 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more
           than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD
           commanded to make.

02:036:006 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be
           proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor
           woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So
           the people were restrained from bringing.

02:036:007 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
           it, and too much.

02:036:008 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
           the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and
           blue, and purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work
           made he them.

02:036:009 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
           breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of
           one size.

02:036:010 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the
           other five curtains he coupled one unto another.

02:036:011 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
           selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost
           side of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.

02:036:012 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in
           the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the
           second: the loops held one curtain to another.

02:036:013 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one
           unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.

02:036:014 And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the
           tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.

02:036:015 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits
           was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of
           one size.

02:036:016 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains
           by themselves.

02:036:017 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
           in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the
           curtain which coupleth the second.

02:036:018 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,
           that it might be one.

02:036:019 And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,
           and a covering of badgers' skins above that.

02:036:020 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood,
           standing up.

02:036:021 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a
           board one cubit and a half.

02:036:022 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another:
           thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.

02:036:023 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the
           south side southward:

02:036:024 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
           two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two
           sockets under another board for his two tenons.

02:036:025 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the
           north corner, he made twenty boards,

02:036:026 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one
           board, and two sockets under another board.

02:036:027 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six
           boards.

02:036:028 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in
           the two sides.

02:036:029 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the
           head thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both
           the corners.

02:036:030 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen
           sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.

02:036:031 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the
           one side of the tabernacle,

02:036:032 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
           tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for
           the sides westward.

02:036:033 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from
           the one end to the other.

02:036:034 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of
           gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with
           gold.

02:036:035 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
           twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

02:036:036 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and
           overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast
           for them four sockets of silver.

02:036:037 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and
           purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

02:036:038 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid
           their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five
           sockets were of brass.

02:037:001 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
           half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth
           of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:

02:037:002 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made
           a crown of gold to it round about.

02:037:003 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four
           corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two
           rings upon the other side of it.

02:037:004 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           gold.

02:037:005 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark,
           to bear the ark.

02:037:006 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half
           was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth
           thereof.

02:037:007 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece
           made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;

02:037:008 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the
           other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the
           cherubims on the two ends thereof.

02:037:009 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered
           with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to
           another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the
           cherubims.

02:037:010 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the
           length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit
           and a half the height thereof:

02:037:011 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown
           of gold round about.

02:037:012 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;
           and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

02:037:013 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon
           the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

02:037:014 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the
           staves to bear the table.

02:037:015 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           gold, to bear the table.

02:037:016 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes,
           and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal,
           of pure gold.

02:037:017 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made
           he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his
           knops, and his flowers, were of the same:

02:037:018 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three
           branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and
           three branches of the candlestick out of the other side
           thereof:

02:037:019 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a
           knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in
           another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six
           branches going out of the candlestick.

02:037:020 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his
           knops, and his flowers:

02:037:021 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under
           two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the
           same, according to the six branches going out of it.

02:037:022 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was
           one beaten work of pure gold.

02:037:023 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his
           snuffdishes, of pure gold.

02:037:024 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels
           thereof.

02:037:025 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of
           it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was
           foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns
           thereof were of the same.

02:037:026 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the
           sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made
           unto it a crown of gold round about.

02:037:027 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof,
           by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be
           places for the staves to bear it withal.

02:037:028 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           gold.

02:037:029 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of
           sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

02:038:001 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five
           cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth
           thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height
           thereof.

02:038:002 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the
           horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

02:038:003 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the
           shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans:
           all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

02:038:004 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the
           compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

02:038:005 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of
           brass, to be places for the staves.

02:038:006 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
           brass.

02:038:007 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the
           altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with
           boards.

02:038:008 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass,
           of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled
           at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

02:038:009 And he made the court: on the south side southward the
           hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred
           cubits:

02:038:010 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty;
           the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

02:038:011 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits,
           their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty;
           the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

02:038:012 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their
           pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars
           and their fillets of silver.

02:038:013 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

02:038:014 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits;
           their pillars three, and their sockets three.

02:038:015 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and
           that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars
           three, and their sockets three.

02:038:016 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined
           linen.

02:038:017 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of
           the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of
           their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court
           were filleted with silver.

02:038:018 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of
           blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and
           twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth
           was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.

02:038:019 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;
           their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters
           and their fillets of silver.

02:038:020 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round
           about, were of brass.

02:038:021 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
           testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of
           Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar,
           son to Aaron the priest.

02:038:022 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
           Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

02:038:023 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of
           Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in
           blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

02:038:024 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of
           the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and
           nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the
           shekel of the sanctuary.

02:038:025 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation
           was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and
           threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the
           sanctuary:

02:038:026 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the
           shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be
           numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred
           thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.

02:038:027 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of
           the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets
           of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

02:038:028 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he
           made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and
           filleted them.

02:038:029 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two
           thousand and four hundred shekels.

02:038:030 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the
           brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

02:038:031 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of
           the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all
           the pins of the court round about.

02:039:001 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
           service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy
           garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:002 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet,
           and fine twined linen.

02:039:003 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into
           wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the
           scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

02:039:004 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the
           two edges was it coupled together.

02:039:005 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of
           the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and
           purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:039:006 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold,
           graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children
           of Israel.

02:039:007 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they
           should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as
           the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:008 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of
           the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
           twined linen.

02:039:009 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span
           was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being
           doubled.

02:039:010 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a
           sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

02:039:011 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

02:039:012 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

02:039:013 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were
           inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

02:039:014 And the stones were according to the names of the children of
           Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
           of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve
           tribes.

02:039:015 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of
           wreathen work of pure gold.

02:039:016 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put
           the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

02:039:017 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings
           on the ends of the breastplate.

02:039:018 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in
           the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the
           ephod, before it.

02:039:019 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends
           of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the
           side of the ephod inward.

02:039:020 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two
           sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over
           against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle
           of the ephod.

02:039:021 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings
           of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the
           curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might
           not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:022 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

02:039:023 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of
           an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should
           not rend.

02:039:024 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,
           and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

02:039:025 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between
           the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between
           the pomegranates;

02:039:026 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round
           about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:039:027 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and
           for his sons,

02:039:028 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen,
           and linen breeches of fine twined linen,

02:039:029 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
           scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:030 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and
           wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet,
           HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

02:039:031 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high
           upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

02:039:032 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
           congregation finished: and the children of Israel did
           according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

02:039:033 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all
           his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his
           pillars, and his sockets,

02:039:034 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of
           badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,

02:039:035 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the
           mercy seat,

02:039:036 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,

02:039:037 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the
           lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the
           oil for light,

02:039:038 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
           incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

02:039:039 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all
           his vessels, the laver and his foot,

02:039:040 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and
           the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and
           all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent
           of the congregation,

02:039:041 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the
           holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to
           minister in the priest's office.

02:039:042 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the
           children of Israel made all the work.

02:039:043 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had
           done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it:
           and Moses blessed them.

02:040:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

02:040:002 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the
           tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

02:040:003 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
           the ark with the vail.

02:040:004 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
           that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in
           the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

02:040:005 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before
           the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to
           the tabernacle.

02:040:006 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
           door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

02:040:007 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the
           congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

02:040:008 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
           hanging at the court gate.

02:040:009 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the
           tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and
           all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.

02:040:010 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
           his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar
           most holy.

02:040:011 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

02:040:012 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

02:040:013 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint
           him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the
           priest's office.

02:040:014 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

02:040:015 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father,
           that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for
           their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood
           throughout their generations.

02:040:016 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him,
           so did he.

02:040:017 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
           the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

02:040:018 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
           and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof,
           and reared up his pillars.

02:040:019 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
           covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

02:040:020 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
           staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

02:040:021 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the
           vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as
           the LORD commanded Moses.

02:040:022 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
           side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

02:040:023 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the
           LORD had commanded Moses.

02:040:024 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation,
           over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle
           southward.

02:040:025 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:040:026 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
           before the vail:

02:040:027 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

02:040:028 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

02:040:029 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
           tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon
           it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:040:030 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
           the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

02:040:031 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
           feet thereat:

02:040:032 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when
           they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

02:040:033 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
           altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses
           finished the work.

02:040:034 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
           glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

02:040:035 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
           congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory
           of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

02:040:036 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
           children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

02:040:037 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not
           till the day that it was taken up.

02:040:038 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
           fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of
           Israel, throughout all their journeys.

Book 03        Leviticus

03:001:001 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

03:001:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
           man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring
           your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the
           flock.

03:001:003 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him
           offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own
           voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation before the LORD.

03:001:004 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering;
           and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

03:001:005 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the
           priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the
           blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation.

03:001:006 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his
           pieces.

03:001:007 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the
           altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:

03:001:008 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head,
           and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which
           is upon the altar:

03:001:009 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the
           priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice,
           an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:001:010 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or
           of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male
           without blemish.

03:001:011 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before
           the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his
           blood round about upon the altar.

03:001:012 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his
           fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that
           is on the fire which is upon the altar:

03:001:013 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the
           priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a
           burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
           unto the LORD.

03:001:014 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of
           fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of
           young pigeons.

03:001:015 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off
           his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof
           shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:

03:001:016 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast
           it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the
           ashes:

03:001:017 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not
           divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the
           altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt
           sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
           the LORD.

03:002:001 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his
           offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon
           it, and put frankincense thereon:

03:002:002 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he
           shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of
           the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the
           priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an
           offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:

03:002:003 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his
           sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD
           made by fire.

03:002:004 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
           oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with
           oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

03:002:005 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it
           shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

03:002:006 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a
           meat offering.

03:002:007 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan,
           it shall be made of fine flour with oil.

03:002:008 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these
           things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the
           priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.

03:002:009 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
           thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering
           made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:002:010 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's
           and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the
           LORD made by fire.

03:002:011 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
           made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey,
           in any offering of the LORD made by fire.

03:002:012 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them
           unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a
           sweet savour.

03:002:013 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with
           salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of
           thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine
           offerings thou shalt offer salt.

03:002:014 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
           LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy
           firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn
           beaten out of full ears.

03:002:015 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon:
           it is a meat offering.

03:002:016 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the
           beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the
           frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the
           LORD.

03:003:001 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he
           offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall
           offer it without blemish before the LORD.

03:003:002 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
           kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and
           Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the
           altar round about.

03:003:003 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the
           inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

03:003:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
           the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it
           shall he take away.

03:003:005 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt
           sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is
           an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:003:006 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the
           LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it
           without blemish.

03:003:007 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it
           before the LORD.

03:003:008 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
           kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's
           sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the
           altar.

03:003:009 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the
           whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the
           fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon
           the inwards,

03:003:010 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
           by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
           it shall he take away.

03:003:011 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of
           the offering made by fire unto the LORD.

03:003:012 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before
           the LORD.

03:003:013 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it
           before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of
           Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round
           about.

03:003:014 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made
           by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and
           all the fat that is upon the inwards,

03:003:015 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
           by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
           it shall he take away.

03:003:016 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food
           of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat
           is the LORD's.

03:003:017 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations
           throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor
           blood.

03:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:004:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin
           through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD
           concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do
           against any of them:

03:004:003 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of
           the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath
           sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a
           sin offering.

03:004:004 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle
           of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand
           upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

03:004:005 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's
           blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

03:004:006 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle
           of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of
           the sanctuary.

03:004:007 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of
           the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the
           tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood
           of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt
           offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

03:004:008 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for
           the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all
           the fat that is upon the inwards,

03:004:009 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
           by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
           it shall he take away,

03:004:010 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace
           offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of
           the burnt offering.

03:004:011 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,
           and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

03:004:012 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp
           unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn
           him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out
           shall he be burnt.

03:004:013 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,
           and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they
           have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD
           concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;

03:004:014 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known,
           then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin,
           and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:004:015 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon
           the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall
           be killed before the LORD.

03:004:016 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's
           blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:

03:004:017 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and
           sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

03:004:018 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
           which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom
           of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:004:019 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the
           altar.

03:004:020 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock
           for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest
           shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven
           them.

03:004:021 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and
           burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering
           for the congregation.

03:004:022 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance
           against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning
           things which should not be done, and is guilty;

03:004:023 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge;
           he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male
           without blemish:

03:004:024 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill
           it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the
           LORD: it is a sin offering.

03:004:025 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
           with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
           burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of
           the altar of burnt offering.

03:004:026 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of
           the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an
           atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be
           forgiven him.

03:004:027 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance,
           while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the
           LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be
           guilty;

03:004:028 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge:
           then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female
           without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.

03:004:029 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
           and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

03:004:030 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his
           finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt
           offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the
           bottom of the altar.

03:004:031 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is
           taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the
           priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto
           the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and
           it shall be forgiven him.

03:004:032 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
           female without blemish.

03:004:033 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
           and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill
           the burnt offering.

03:004:034 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
           with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
           burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at
           the bottom of the altar:

03:004:035 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the
           lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
           and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to
           the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall
           make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it
           shall be forgiven him.

03:005:001 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a
           witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not
           utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.

03:005:002 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase
           of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the
           carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from
           him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.

03:005:003 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness
           it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from
           him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

03:005:004 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or
           to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with
           an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then
           he shall be guilty in one of these.

03:005:005 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these
           things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that
           thing:

03:005:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his
           sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a
           kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall
           make an atonement for him concerning his sin.

03:005:007 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for
           his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two
           young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the
           other for a burnt offering.

03:005:008 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that
           which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head
           from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:

03:005:009 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon
           the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be
           wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.

03:005:010 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according
           to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him
           for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven
           him.

03:005:011 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
           pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the
           tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he
           shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any
           frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.

03:005:012 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall
           take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it
           on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the
           LORD: it is a sin offering.

03:005:013 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
           sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be
           forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat
           offering.

03:005:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:005:015 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the
           holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass
           unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with
           thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the
           sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

03:005:016 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
           holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it
           unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for
           him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be
           forgiven him.

03:005:017 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
           forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though
           he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

03:005:018 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock,
           with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:
           and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his
           ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be
           forgiven him.

03:005:019 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed
           against the LORD.

03:006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:002 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie
           unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or
           in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath
           deceived his neighbour;

03:006:003 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it,
           and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth,
           sinning therein:

03:006:004 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that
           he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the
           thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was
           delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,

03:006:005 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even
           restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more
           thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the
           day of his trespass offering.

03:006:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram
           without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a
           trespass offering, unto the priest:

03:006:007 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the
           LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that
           he hath done in trespassing therein.

03:006:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:009 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the
           burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the
           burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the
           fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

03:006:010 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
           breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes
           which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the
           altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.

03:006:011 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments,
           and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

03:006:012 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall
           not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every
           morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he
           shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.

03:006:013 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never
           go out.

03:006:014 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron
           shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

03:006:015 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
           offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense
           which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the
           altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the
           LORD.

03:006:016 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
           unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the
           court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

03:006:017 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them
           for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most
           holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

03:006:018 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It
           shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
           offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth
           them shall be holy.

03:006:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:020 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they
           shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the
           tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering
           perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at
           night.

03:006:021 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
           shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering
           shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:006:022 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
           offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be
           wholly burnt.

03:006:023 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt:
           it shall not be eaten.

03:006:024 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:006:025 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of
           the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is
           killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is
           most holy.

03:006:026 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
           place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

03:006:027 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and
           when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment,
           thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy
           place.

03:006:028 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken:
           and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured,
           and rinsed in water.

03:006:029 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
           holy.

03:006:030 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into
           the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the
           holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

03:007:001 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most
           holy.

03:007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they
           kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he
           sprinkle round about upon the altar.

03:007:003 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and
           the fat that covereth the inwards,

03:007:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
           the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the
           kidneys, it shall he take away:

03:007:005 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering
           made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.

03:007:006 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be
           eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.

03:007:007 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is
           one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith
           shall have it.

03:007:008 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even
           the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt
           offering which he hath offered.

03:007:009 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all
           that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the
           priest's that offereth it.

03:007:010 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all
           the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

03:007:011 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
           he shall offer unto the LORD.

03:007:012 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with
           the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with
           oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes
           mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

03:007:013 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened
           bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace
           offerings.

03:007:014 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
           heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's
           that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

03:007:015 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
           thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered;
           he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

03:007:016 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
           offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
           sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be
           eaten:

03:007:017 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third
           day shall be burnt with fire.

03:007:018 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace
           offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be
           accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth
           it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it
           shall bear his iniquity.

03:007:019 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be
           eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all
           that be clean shall eat thereof.

03:007:020 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of
           peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his
           uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his
           people.

03:007:021 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
           uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable
           unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
           offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall
           be cut off from his people.

03:007:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:007:023 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no
           manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

03:007:024 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
           that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use:
           but ye shall in no wise eat of it.

03:007:025 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer
           an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that
           eateth it shall be cut off from his people.

03:007:026 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of
           fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

03:007:027 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even
           that soul shall be cut off from his people.

03:007:028 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:007:029 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth
           the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring
           his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace
           offerings.

03:007:030 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by
           fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the
           breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.

03:007:031 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the
           breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

03:007:032 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an
           heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

03:007:033 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the
           peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder
           for his part.

03:007:034 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
           children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace
           offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto
           his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of
           Israel.

03:007:035 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
           anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made
           by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto
           the LORD in the priest's office;

03:007:036 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of
           Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for
           ever throughout their generations.

03:007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering,
           and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of
           the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace
           offerings;

03:007:038 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that
           he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations
           unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

03:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:008:002 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
           anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two
           rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;

03:008:003 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:008:004 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was
           gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

03:008:005 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which
           the LORD commanded to be done.

03:008:006 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with
           water.

03:008:007 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle,
           and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and
           he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound
           it unto him therewith.

03:008:008 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the
           breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.

03:008:009 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even
           upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy
           crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:010 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle
           and all that was therein, and sanctified them.

03:008:011 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and
           anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his
           foot, to sanctify them.

03:008:012 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and
           anointed him, to sanctify him.

03:008:013 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and
           girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the
           LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:014 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and
           his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the
           sin offering.

03:008:015 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the
           horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified
           the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar,
           and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.

03:008:016 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the
           caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and
           Moses burned it upon the altar.

03:008:017 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he
           burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:018 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and
           his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

03:008:019 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
           round about.

03:008:020 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and
           the pieces, and the fat.

03:008:021 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses
           burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice
           for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the
           LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:022 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and
           Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

03:008:023 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it
           upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his
           right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

03:008:024 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon
           the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right
           hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses
           sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

03:008:025 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was
           upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two
           kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:

03:008:026 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the
           LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread,
           and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right
           shoulder:

03:008:027 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands,
           and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.

03:008:028 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on
           the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for
           a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

03:008:029 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
           before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses'
           part; as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:008:030 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which
           was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his
           garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with
           him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and
           his sons' garments with him.

03:008:031 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at
           the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat
           it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I
           commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

03:008:032 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall
           ye burn with fire.

03:008:033 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation in seven days, until the days of your
           consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate
           you.

03:008:034 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to
           make an atonement for you.

03:008:035 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of
           the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

03:008:036 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded
           by the hand of Moses.

03:009:001 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron
           and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

03:009:002 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin
           offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and
           offer them before the LORD.

03:009:003 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take
           ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a
           lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt
           offering;

03:009:004 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice
           before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to
           day the LORD will appear unto you.

03:009:005 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the
           tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew
           near and stood before the LORD.

03:009:006 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded
           that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto
           you.

03:009:007 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy
           sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement
           for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the
           people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.

03:009:008 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the
           sin offering, which was for himself.

03:009:009 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he
           dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of
           the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the
           altar:

03:009:010 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of
           the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

03:009:011 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the
           camp.

03:009:012 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented
           unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the
           altar.

03:009:013 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the
           pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the
           altar.

03:009:014 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon
           the burnt offering on the altar.

03:009:015 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which
           was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered
           it for sin, as the first.

03:009:016 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
           the manner.

03:009:017 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
           and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the
           morning.

03:009:018 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
           offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons
           presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the
           altar round about,

03:009:019 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that
           which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul
           above the liver:

03:009:020 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat
           upon the altar:

03:009:021 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave
           offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

03:009:022 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed
           them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the
           burnt offering, and peace offerings.

03:009:023 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the
           glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.

03:009:024 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed
           upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all
           the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

03:010:001 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them
           his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and
           offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them
           not.

03:010:002 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and
           they died before the LORD.

03:010:003 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,
           saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and
           before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his
           peace.

03:010:004 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
           uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your
           brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

03:010:005 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
           camp; as Moses had said.

03:010:006 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
           his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes;
           lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let
           your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning
           which the LORD hath kindled.

03:010:007 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD
           is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

03:010:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,

03:010:009 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with
           thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest
           ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
           generations:

03:010:010 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and
           between unclean and clean;

03:010:011 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes
           which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

03:010:012 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
           his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth
           of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without
           leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:

03:010:013 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due,
           and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire:
           for so I am commanded.

03:010:014 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
           place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for
           they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the
           sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.

03:010:015 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with
           the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave
           offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons'
           with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.

03:010:016 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
           behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and
           Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,

03:010:017 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy
           place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to
           bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for
           them before the LORD?

03:010:018 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy
           place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I
           commanded.

03:010:019 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
           their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD;
           and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin
           offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of
           the LORD?

03:010:020 And when Moses heard that, he was content.

03:011:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

03:011:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the
           beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the
           earth.

03:011:003 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth
           the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

03:011:004 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud,
           or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he
           cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto
           you.

03:011:005 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not
           the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

03:011:006 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
           hoof; he is unclean unto you.

03:011:007 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
           yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

03:011:008 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye
           not touch; they are unclean to you.

03:011:009 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever
           hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the
           rivers, them shall ye eat.

03:011:010 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
           rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living
           thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination
           unto you:

03:011:011 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat
           of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in
           abomination.

03:011:012 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall
           be an abomination unto you.

03:011:013 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among
           the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination:
           the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

03:011:014 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

03:011:015 Every raven after his kind;

03:011:016 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
           after his kind,

03:011:017 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

03:011:018 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

03:011:019 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and
           the bat.

03:011:020 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an
           abomination unto you.

03:011:021 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth
           upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap
           withal upon the earth;

03:011:022 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and
           the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind,
           and the grasshopper after his kind.

03:011:023 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,
           shall be an abomination unto you.

03:011:024 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the
           carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

03:011:025 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
           his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

03:011:026 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is
           not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you:
           every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.

03:011:027 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
           that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso
           toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.

03:011:028 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his
           clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto
           you.

03:011:029 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
           that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the
           tortoise after his kind,

03:011:030 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the
           snail, and the mole.

03:011:031 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth
           touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the
           even.

03:011:032 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth
           fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood,
           or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein
           any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be
           unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

03:011:033 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,
           whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

03:011:034 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water
           cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in
           every such vessel shall be unclean.

03:011:035 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
           shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they
           shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be
           unclean unto you.

03:011:036 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of
           water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase
           shall be unclean.

03:011:037 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed
           which is to be sown, it shall be clean.

03:011:038 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their
           carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

03:011:039 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth
           the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

03:011:040 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his
           clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth
           the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
           the even.

03:011:041 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
           an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

03:011:042 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
           four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things
           that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are
           an abomination.

03:011:043 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping
           thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean
           with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.

03:011:044 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
           yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall
           ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that
           creepeth upon the earth.

03:011:045 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of
           Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am
           holy.

03:011:046 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every
           living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every
           creature that creepeth upon the earth:

03:011:047 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and
           between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not
           be eaten.

03:012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:012:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have
           conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be
           unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation
           for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

03:012:003 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
           circumcised.

03:012:004 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying
           three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor
           come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be
           fulfilled.

03:012:005 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two
           weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the
           blood of her purifying threescore and six days.

03:012:006 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son,
           or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year
           for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for
           a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, unto the priest:

03:012:007 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for
           her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.
           This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

03:012:008 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring
           two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt
           offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest
           shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.

03:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

03:013:002 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a
           scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like
           the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the
           priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:

03:013:003 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the
           flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and
           the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it
           is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and
           pronounce him unclean.

03:013:004 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in
           sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not
           turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the
           plague seven days:

03:013:005 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold,
           if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread
           not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days
           more:

03:013:006 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
           behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread
           not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is
           but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

03:013:007 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
           hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be
           seen of the priest again.

03:013:008 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
           skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
           leprosy.

03:013:009 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be
           brought unto the priest;

03:013:010 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be
           white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and
           there be quick raw flesh in the rising;

03:013:011 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest
           shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he
           is unclean.

03:013:012 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
           cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head
           even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

03:013:013 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy
           have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that
           hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.

03:013:014 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

03:013:015 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to
           be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

03:013:016 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he
           shall come unto the priest;

03:013:017 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be
           turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean
           that hath the plague: he is clean.

03:013:018 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a
           boil, and is healed,

03:013:019 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a
           bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to
           the priest;

03:013:020 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower
           than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the
           priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy
           broken out of the boil.

03:013:021 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
           hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be
           somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

03:013:022 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest
           shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

03:013:023 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it
           is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

03:013:024 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
           burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright
           spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

03:013:025 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair
           in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper
           than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning:
           wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the
           plague of leprosy.

03:013:026 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
           hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other
           skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up
           seven days:

03:013:027 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it
           be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
           pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

03:013:028 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in
           the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the
           burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is
           an inflammation of the burning.

03:013:029 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

03:013:030 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in
           sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin
           hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry
           scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.

03:013:031 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and,
           behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that
           there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up
           him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:

03:013:032 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:
           and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no
           yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the
           skin;

03:013:033 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the
           priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:

03:013:034 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall:
           and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in
           sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce
           him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

03:013:035 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

03:013:036 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall
           be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow
           hair; he is unclean.

03:013:037 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is
           black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean:
           and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

03:013:038 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh
           bright spots, even white bright spots;

03:013:039 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots
           in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled
           spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.

03:013:040 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet
           is he clean.

03:013:041 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
           toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

03:013:042 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white
           reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or
           his bald forehead.

03:013:043 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising
           of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald
           forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

03:013:044 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce
           him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

03:013:045 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be
           rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his
           upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

03:013:046 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
           defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp
           shall his habitation be.

03:013:047 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it
           be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;

03:013:048 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen;
           whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

03:013:049 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in
           the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing
           of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto
           the priest:

03:013:050 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that
           hath the plague seven days:

03:013:051 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the
           plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
           woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the
           plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.

03:013:052 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
           woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague
           is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the
           fire.

03:013:053 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not
           spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or
           in any thing of skin;

03:013:054 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein
           the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:

03:013:055 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is
           washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his
           colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou
           shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be
           bare within or without.

03:013:056 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat
           dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the
           garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the
           woof:

03:013:057 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or
           in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading
           plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.

03:013:058 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of
           skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed
           from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall
           be clean.

03:013:059 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of
           woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of
           skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

03:014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:014:002 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his
           cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:

03:014:003 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest
           shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in
           the leper;

03:014:004 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be
           cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and
           scarlet, and hyssop:

03:014:005 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed
           in an earthen vessel over running water:

03:014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,
           and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the
           living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the
           running water:

03:014:007 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the
           leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall
           let the living bird loose into the open field.

03:014:008 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and
           shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may
           be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and
           shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.

03:014:009 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all
           his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all
           his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes,
           also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

03:014:010 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without
           blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish,
           and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering,
           mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

03:014:011 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man
           that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD,
           at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

03:014:012 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a
           trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a
           wave offering before the LORD:

03:014:013 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill
           the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place:
           for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass
           offering: it is most holy:

03:014:014 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
           offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the
           right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of
           his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

03:014:015 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it
           into the palm of his own left hand:

03:014:016 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is
           in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his
           finger seven times before the LORD:

03:014:017 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the
           priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
           cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
           great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass
           offering:

03:014:018 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he
           shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and
           the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.

03:014:019 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an
           atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness;
           and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:

03:014:020 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat
           offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an
           atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

03:014:021 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take
           one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an
           atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled
           with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;

03:014:022 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able
           to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a
           burnt offering.

03:014:023 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing
           unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, before the LORD.

03:014:024 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering,
           and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave
           offering before the LORD:

03:014:025 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the
           priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering,
           and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
           cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
           great toe of his right foot:

03:014:026 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own
           left hand:

03:014:027 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of
           the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:

03:014:028 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon
           the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and
           upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of
           his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass
           offering:

03:014:029 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall
           put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an
           atonement for him before the LORD.

03:014:030 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
           pigeons, such as he can get;

03:014:031 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering,
           and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering:
           and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be
           cleansed before the LORD.

03:014:032 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose
           hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his
           cleansing.

03:014:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

03:014:034 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you
           for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house
           of the land of your possession;

03:014:035 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest,
           saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the
           house:

03:014:036 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house,
           before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that
           is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest
           shall go in to see the house:

03:014:037 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be
           in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or
           reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;

03:014:038 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
           house, and shut up the house seven days:

03:014:039 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall
           look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the
           house;

03:014:040 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones
           in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an
           unclean place without the city:

03:014:041 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about,
           and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without
           the city into an unclean place:

03:014:042 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of
           those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall
           plaister the house.

03:014:043 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house,
           after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath
           scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

03:014:044 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the
           plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the
           house; it is unclean.

03:014:045 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the
           timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall
           carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

03:014:046 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is
           shut up shall be unclean until the even.

03:014:047 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he
           that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

03:014:048 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and,
           behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the
           house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the
           house clean, because the plague is healed.

03:014:049 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar
           wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

03:014:050 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel
           over running water:

03:014:051 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the
           scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the
           slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house
           seven times:

03:014:052 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and
           with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the
           cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

03:014:053 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the
           open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall
           be clean.

03:014:054 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and
           scall,

03:014:055 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

03:014:056 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

03:014:057 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the
           law of leprosy.

03:015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

03:015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any
           man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his
           issue he is unclean.

03:015:003 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his
           flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his
           issue, it is his uncleanness.

03:015:004 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean:
           and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

03:015:005 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

03:015:006 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the
           issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
           be unclean until the even.

03:015:007 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue
           shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
           unclean until the even.

03:015:008 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean;
           then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
           and be unclean until the even.

03:015:009 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue
           shall be unclean.

03:015:010 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be
           unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those
           things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
           be unclean until the even.

03:015:011 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not
           rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

03:015:012 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the
           issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be
           rinsed in water.

03:015:013 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then
           he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and
           wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and
           shall be clean.

03:015:014 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or
           two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the
           priest:

03:015:015 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering,
           and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make
           an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.

03:015:016 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he
           shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the
           even.

03:015:017 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
           copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until
           the even.

03:015:018 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of
           copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be
           unclean until the even.

03:015:019 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
           blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever
           toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.

03:015:020 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
           unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be
           unclean.

03:015:021 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

03:015:022 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash
           his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until
           the even.

03:015:023 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth,
           when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

03:015:024 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon
           him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon
           he lieth shall be unclean.

03:015:025 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the
           time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her
           separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall
           be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.

03:015:026 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be
           unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she
           sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her
           separation.

03:015:027 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and
           shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
           unclean until the even.

03:015:028 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
           herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

03:015:029 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or
           two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door
           of the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:015:030 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
           other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an
           atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her
           uncleanness.

03:015:031 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
           uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they
           defile my tabernacle that is among them.

03:015:032 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose
           seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

03:015:033 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath
           an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth
           with her that is unclean.

03:016:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons
           of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;

03:016:002 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother,
           that he come not at all times into the holy place within the
           vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die
           not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

03:016:003 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young
           bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

03:016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the
           linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a
           linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired:
           these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in
           water, and so put them on.

03:016:005 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of
           Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram
           for a burnt offering.

03:016:006 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which
           is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his
           house.

03:016:007 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the
           LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

03:016:008 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
           LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

03:016:009 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,
           and offer him for a sin offering.

03:016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall
           be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with
           him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

03:016:011 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which
           is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and
           for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering
           which is for himself:

03:016:012 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from
           off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet
           incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:

03:016:013 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD,
           that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is
           upon the testimony, that he die not:

03:016:014 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it
           with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the
           mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger
           seven times.

03:016:015 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for
           the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with
           that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and
           sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:

03:016:016 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of
           the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of
           their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for
           the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them
           in the midst of their uncleanness.

03:016:017 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the
           congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy
           place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for
           himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation
           of Israel.

03:016:018 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD,
           and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of
           the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the
           horns of the altar round about.

03:016:019 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger
           seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the
           uncleanness of the children of Israel.

03:016:020 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place,
           and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he
           shall bring the live goat:

03:016:021 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
           goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
           of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins,
           putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him
           away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:

03:016:022 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a
           land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the
           wilderness.

03:016:023 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
           and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he
           went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:

03:016:024 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and
           put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt
           offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an
           atonement for himself, and for the people.

03:016:025 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

03:016:026 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
           clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into
           the camp.

03:016:027 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
           offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the
           holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they
           shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their
           dung.

03:016:028 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
           flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

03:016:029 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
           seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict
           your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your
           own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:

03:016:030 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
           cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before
           the LORD.

03:016:031 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
           your souls, by a statute for ever.

03:016:032 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
           consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's
           stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen
           clothes, even the holy garments:

03:016:033 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he
           shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an
           atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the
           congregation.

03:016:034 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
           atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a
           year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

03:017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:017:002 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children
           of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD
           hath commanded, saying,

03:017:003 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth
           an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out
           of the camp,

03:017:004 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the
           tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man;
           he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among
           his people:

03:017:005 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their
           sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they
           may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle
           of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace
           offerings unto the LORD.

03:017:006 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
           LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and
           burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:017:007 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils,
           after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute
           for ever unto them throughout their generations.

03:017:008 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the
           house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you,
           that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,

03:017:009 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall
           be cut off from among his people.

03:017:010 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
           strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of
           blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth
           blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

03:017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it
           to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for
           it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

03:017:012 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you
           shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth
           among you eat blood.

03:017:013 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of
           the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and
           catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even
           pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.

03:017:014 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the
           life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye
           shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all
           flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut
           off.

03:017:015 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that
           which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own
           country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and
           bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then
           shall he be clean.

03:017:016 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall
           bear his iniquity.

03:018:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:018:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the
           LORD your God.

03:018:003 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall
           ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither
           I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their
           ordinances.

03:018:004 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
           therein: I am the LORD your God.

03:018:005 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which
           if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.

03:018:006 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him,
           to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

03:018:007 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,
           shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not
           uncover her nakedness.

03:018:008 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it
           is thy father's nakedness.

03:018:009 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or
           daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born
           abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

03:018:010 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's
           daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for
           theirs is thine own nakedness.

03:018:011 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy
           father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her
           nakedness.

03:018:012 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister:
           she is thy father's near kinswoman.

03:018:013 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister:
           for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.

03:018:014 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,
           thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

03:018:015 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law:
           she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

03:018:016 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it
           is thy brother's nakedness.

03:018:017 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her
           daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her
           daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are
           her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.

03:018:018 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to
           uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

03:018:019 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her
           nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

03:018:020 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's
           wife, to defile thyself with her.

03:018:021 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire
           to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I
           am the LORD.

03:018:022 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
           abomination.

03:018:023 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
           therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie
           down thereto: it is confusion.

03:018:024 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all
           these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

03:018:025 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity
           thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her
           inhabitants.

03:018:026 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and
           shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of
           your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:

03:018:027 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done,
           which were before you, and the land is defiled;)

03:018:028 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it
           spued out the nations that were before you.

03:018:029 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the
           souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their
           people.

03:018:030 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any
           one of these abominable customs, which were committed before
           you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD
           your God.

03:019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:019:002 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and
           say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am
           holy.

03:019:003 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep
           my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:004 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I
           am the LORD your God.

03:019:005 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD,
           ye shall offer it at your own will.

03:019:006 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:
           and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in
           the fire.

03:019:007 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable;
           it shall not be accepted.

03:019:008 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
           because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and
           that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

03:019:009 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not
           wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou
           gather the gleanings of thy harvest.

03:019:010 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou
           gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for
           the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:011 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
           another.

03:019:012 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
           profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

03:019:013 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the
           wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night
           until the morning.

03:019:014 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
           the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.

03:019:015 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
           respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the
           mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

03:019:016 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy
           people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy
           neighbour; I am the LORD.

03:019:017 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in
           any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

03:019:018 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the
           children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as
           thyself: I am the LORD.

03:019:019 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle
           gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with
           mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and
           woollen come upon thee.

03:019:020 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
           betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom
           given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to
           death, because she was not free.

03:019:021 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto
           the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for
           a trespass offering.

03:019:022 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
           the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he
           hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven
           him.

03:019:023 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted
           all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit
           thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as
           uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.

03:019:024 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
           praise the LORD withal.

03:019:025 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that
           it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your
           God.

03:019:026 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye
           use enchantment, nor observe times.

03:019:027 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt
           thou mar the corners of thy beard.

03:019:028 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
           print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.

03:019:029 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore;
           lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of
           wickedness.

03:019:030 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
           the LORD.

03:019:031 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
           wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:032 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face
           of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.

03:019:033 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not
           vex him.

03:019:034 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as
           one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye
           were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

03:019:035 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in
           weight, or in measure.

03:019:036 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin,
           shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out
           of the land of Egypt.

03:019:037 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my
           judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.

03:020:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:020:002 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he
           be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn
           in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall
           surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him
           with stones.

03:020:003 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
           from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto
           Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

03:020:004 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
           the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him
           not:

03:020:005 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his
           family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after
           him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

03:020:006 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
           and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set
           my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his
           people.

03:020:007 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the
           LORD your God.

03:020:008 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD
           which sanctify you.

03:020:009 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
           surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother;
           his blood shall be upon him.

03:020:010 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,
           even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife,
           the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

03:020:011 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered
           his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to
           death; their blood shall be upon them.

03:020:012 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
           surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their
           blood shall be upon them.

03:020:013 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
           of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be
           put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

03:020:014 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness:
           they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be
           no wickedness among you.

03:020:015 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to
           death: and ye shall slay the beast.

03:020:016 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
           thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be
           put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

03:020:017 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or
           his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his
           nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in
           the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's
           nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

03:020:018 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
           shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain,
           and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of
           them shall be cut off from among their people.

03:020:019 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's
           sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near
           kin: they shall bear their iniquity.

03:020:020 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath
           uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin;
           they shall die childless.

03:020:021 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean
           thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall
           be childless.

03:020:022 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
           and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell
           therein, spue you not out.

03:020:023 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I
           cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and
           therefore I abhorred them.

03:020:024 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
           will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with
           milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated
           you from other people.

03:020:025 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
           unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not
           make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any
           manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I
           have separated from you as unclean.

03:020:026 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
           severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

03:020:027 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
           wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them
           with stones: their blood shall be upon them.

03:021:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons
           of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for
           the dead among his people:

03:021:002 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his
           mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his
           daughter, and for his brother.

03:021:003 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath
           had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

03:021:004 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his
           people, to profane himself.

03:021:005 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall
           they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any
           cuttings in their flesh.

03:021:006 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of
           their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the
           bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be
           holy.

03:021:007 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane;
           neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for
           he is holy unto his God.

03:021:008 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread
           of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which
           sanctify you, am holy.

03:021:009 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by
           playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be
           burnt with fire.

03:021:010 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
           head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to
           put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his
           clothes;

03:021:011 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself
           for his father, or for his mother;

03:021:012 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the
           sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of
           his God is upon him: I am the LORD.

03:021:013 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

03:021:014 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these
           shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own
           people to wife.

03:021:015 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the
           LORD do sanctify him.

03:021:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:021:017 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
           generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to
           offer the bread of his God.

03:021:018 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
           approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose,
           or any thing superfluous,

03:021:019 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

03:021:020 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye,
           or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

03:021:021 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest
           shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by
           fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the
           bread of his God.

03:021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and
           of the holy.

03:021:023 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the
           altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my
           sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

03:021:024 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all
           the children of Israel.

03:022:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:022:002 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate
           themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and
           that they profane not my holy name in those things which they
           hallow unto me: I am the LORD.

03:022:003 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
           generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the
           children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his
           uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my
           presence: I am the LORD.

03:022:004 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a
           running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he
           be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the
           dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

03:022:005 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be
           made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness,
           whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

03:022:006 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until
           even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his
           flesh with water.

03:022:007 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall
           afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.

03:022:008 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall
           not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.

03:022:009 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin
           for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do
           sanctify them.

03:022:010 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
           the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy
           thing.

03:022:011 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
           it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his
           meat.

03:022:012 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she
           may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

03:022:013 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have
           no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her
           youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be
           no stranger eat thereof.

03:022:014 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
           put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the
           priest with the holy thing.

03:022:015 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
           Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

03:022:016 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat
           their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

03:022:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:022:018 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children
           of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of
           Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his
           oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings,
           which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;

03:022:019 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the
           beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

03:022:020 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it
           shall not be acceptable for you.

03:022:021 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
           LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves
           or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be
           no blemish therein.

03:022:022 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
           scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an
           offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

03:022:023 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
           lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill
           offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

03:022:024 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or
           crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering
           thereof in your land.

03:022:025 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of
           your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them,
           and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

03:022:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:022:027 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then
           it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day
           and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by
           fire unto the LORD.

03:022:028 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her
           young both in one day.

03:022:029 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the
           LORD, offer it at your own will.

03:022:030 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of
           it until the morrow: I am the LORD.

03:022:031 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the
           LORD.

03:022:032 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed
           among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,

03:022:033 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I
           am the LORD.

03:023:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
           Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
           be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.

03:023:003 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the
           sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work
           therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

03:023:004 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations,
           which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.

03:023:005 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's
           passover.

03:023:006 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of
           unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat
           unleavened bread.

03:023:007 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall
           do no servile work therein.

03:023:008 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD
           seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye
           shall do no servile work therein.

03:023:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap
           the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the
           firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:

03:023:011 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted
           for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave
           it.

03:023:012 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
           without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto
           the LORD.

03:023:013 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine
           flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD
           for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of
           wine, the fourth part of an hin.

03:023:014 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green
           ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering
           unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
           generations in all your dwellings.

03:023:015 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,
           from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering;
           seven sabbaths shall be complete:

03:023:016 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number
           fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the
           LORD.

03:023:017 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two
           tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken
           with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.

03:023:018 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish
           of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they
           shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat
           offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by
           fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.

03:023:019 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin
           offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of
           peace offerings.

03:023:020 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the
           firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two
           lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.

03:023:021 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an
           holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work
           therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings
           throughout your generations.

03:023:022 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make
           clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest,
           neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou
           shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the
           LORD your God.

03:023:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:024 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh
           month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath,
           a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.

03:023:025 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an
           offering made by fire unto the LORD.

03:023:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:027 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a
           day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you;
           and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by
           fire unto the LORD.

03:023:028 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
           atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your
           God.

03:023:029 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
           same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

03:023:030 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same
           day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

03:023:031 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
           throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

03:023:032 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
           your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even
           unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

03:023:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:023:034 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day
           of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for
           seven days unto the LORD.

03:023:035 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
           servile work therein.

03:023:036 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the
           LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you;
           and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it
           is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.

03:023:037 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
           be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto
           the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice,
           and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:

03:023:038 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and
           beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings,
           which ye give unto the LORD.

03:023:039 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
           gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto
           the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and
           on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.

03:023:040 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly
           trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees,
           and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD
           your God seven days.

03:023:041 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the
           year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye
           shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

03:023:042 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites
           born shall dwell in booths:

03:023:043 That your generations may know that I made the children of
           Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land
           of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

03:023:044 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of
           the LORD.

03:024:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:024:002 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure
           oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn
           continually.

03:024:003 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the
           morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for
           ever in your generations.

03:024:004 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
           LORD continually.

03:024:005 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:
           two tenth deals shall be in one cake.

03:024:006 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the
           pure table before the LORD.

03:024:007 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it
           may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by
           fire unto the LORD.

03:024:008 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD
           continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an
           everlasting covenant.

03:024:009 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it
           in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the
           offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.

03:024:010 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an
           Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son
           of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together
           in the camp;

03:024:011 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the
           Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his
           mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the
           tribe of Dan:)

03:024:012 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be
           shewed them.

03:024:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:024:014 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all
           that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the
           congregation stone him.

03:024:015 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
           Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

03:024:016 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely
           be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly
           stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the
           land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put
           to death.

03:024:017 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

03:024:018 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for
           beast.

03:024:019 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath
           done, so shall it be done to him;

03:024:020 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath
           caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.

03:024:021 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
           killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

03:024:022 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as
           for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.

03:024:023 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should
           bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him
           with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

03:025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

03:025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep
           a sabbath unto the LORD.

03:025:003 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt
           prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

03:025:004 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the
           land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy
           field, nor prune thy vineyard.

03:025:005 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
           not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for
           it is a year of rest unto the land.

03:025:006 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee,
           and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired
           servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

03:025:007 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land,
           shall all the increase thereof be meat.

03:025:008 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
           times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of
           years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.

03:025:009 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on
           the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement
           shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

03:025:010 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
           throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it
           shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto
           his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.

03:025:011 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not
           sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor
           gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.

03:025:012 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
           the increase thereof out of the field.

03:025:013 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
           possession.

03:025:014 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
           thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:

03:025:015 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt
           buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years
           of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:

03:025:016 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the
           price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou
           shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of
           the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.

03:025:017 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt
           fear thy God: for I am the LORD your God.

03:025:018 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and
           do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

03:025:019 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your
           fill, and dwell therein in safety.

03:025:020 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?
           behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

03:025:021 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year,
           and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

03:025:022 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit
           until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of
           the old store.

03:025:023 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for
           ye are strangers and sojourners with me.

03:025:024 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
           redemption for the land.

03:025:025 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
           possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then
           shall he redeem that which his brother sold.

03:025:026 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
           redeem it;

03:025:027 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore
           the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may
           return unto his possession.

03:025:028 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
           sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until
           the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he
           shall return unto his possession.

03:025:029 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he
           may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a
           full year may he redeem it.

03:025:030 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year,
           then the house that is in the walled city shall be established
           for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it
           shall not go out in the jubile.

03:025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
           them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may
           be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.

03:025:032 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of
           the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any
           time.

03:025:033 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
           sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year
           of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are
           their possession among the children of Israel.

03:025:034 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
           for it is their perpetual possession.

03:025:035 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with
           thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a
           stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.

03:025:036 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
           thy brother may live with thee.

03:025:037 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
           victuals for increase.

03:025:038 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
           land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your
           God.

03:025:039 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
           sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
           bondservant:

03:025:040 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
           thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

03:025:041 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
           with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the
           possession of his fathers shall he return.

03:025:042 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the
           land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

03:025:043 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
           God.

03:025:044 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
           shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them
           shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.

03:025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn
           among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that
           are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be
           your possession.

03:025:046 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children
           after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be
           your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of
           Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.

03:025:047 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy
           brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto
           the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the
           stranger's family:

03:025:048 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his
           brethren may redeem him:

03:025:049 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any
           that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or
           if he be able, he may redeem himself.

03:025:050 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year
           that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price
           of his sale shall be according unto the number of years,
           according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with
           him.

03:025:051 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he
           shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money
           that he was bought for.

03:025:052 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile,
           then he shall count with him, and according unto his years
           shall he give him again the price of his redemption.

03:025:053 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
           other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

03:025:054 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
           in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

03:025:055 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
           servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am
           the LORD your God.

03:026:001 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you
           up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of
           stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD
           your God.

03:026:002 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
           the LORD.

03:026:003 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do
           them;

03:026:004 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall
           yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield
           their fruit.

03:026:005 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the
           vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat
           your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

03:026:006 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
           none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of
           the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

03:026:007 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before
           you by the sword.

03:026:008 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
           shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall
           before you by the sword.

03:026:009 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
           multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

03:026:010 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
           the new.

03:026:011 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
           you.

03:026:012 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall
           be my people.

03:026:013 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
           land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have
           broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

03:026:014 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
           commandments;

03:026:015 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my
           judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but
           that ye break my covenant:

03:026:016 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you
           terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume
           the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your
           seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

03:026:017 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain
           before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you;
           and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.

03:026:018 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I
           will punish you seven times more for your sins.

03:026:019 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
           heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

03:026:020 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall
           not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land
           yield their fruits.

03:026:021 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me;
           I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to
           your sins.

03:026:022 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
           your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in
           number; and your high ways shall be desolate.

03:026:023 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
           walk contrary unto me;

03:026:024 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you
           yet seven times for your sins.

03:026:025 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the
           quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together
           within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and
           ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

03:026:026 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women
           shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you
           your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be
           satisfied.

03:026:027 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
           contrary unto me;

03:026:028 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even
           I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

03:026:029 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
           daughters shall ye eat.

03:026:030 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
           and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my
           soul shall abhor you.

03:026:031 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
           unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet
           odours.

03:026:032 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
           which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

03:026:033 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
           sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your
           cities waste.

03:026:034 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
           desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the
           land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

03:026:035 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
           rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

03:026:036 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a
           faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and
           the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall
           flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none
           pursueth.

03:026:037 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a
           sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand
           before your enemies.

03:026:038 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
           enemies shall eat you up.

03:026:039 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their
           iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of
           their fathers shall they pine away with them.

03:026:040 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of
           their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed
           against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;

03:026:041 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have
           brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their
           uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the
           punishment of their iniquity:

03:026:042 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my
           covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I
           remember; and I will remember the land.

03:026:043 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
           sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they
           shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because,
           even because they despised my judgments, and because their
           soul abhorred my statutes.

03:026:044 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their
           enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them,
           to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them:
           for I am the LORD their God.

03:026:045 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
           ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in
           the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the
           LORD.

03:026:046 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
           made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by
           the hand of Moses.

03:027:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

03:027:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a
           man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the
           LORD by thy estimation.

03:027:003 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
           even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty
           shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

03:027:004 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
           shekels.

03:027:005 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old,
           then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and
           for the female ten shekels.

03:027:006 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then
           thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver,
           and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of
           silver.

03:027:007 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,
           then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the
           female ten shekels.

03:027:008 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
           himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him;
           according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value
           him.

03:027:009 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
           LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be
           holy.

03:027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a
           bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast,
           then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.

03:027:011 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
           sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast
           before the priest:

03:027:012 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as
           thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

03:027:013 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth
           part thereof unto thy estimation.

03:027:014 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
           LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or
           bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

03:027:015 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
           shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
           it, and it shall be his.

03:027:016 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
           of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to
           the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at
           fifty shekels of silver.

03:027:017 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
           thy estimation it shall stand.

03:027:018 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
           shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that
           remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be
           abated from thy estimation.

03:027:019 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem
           it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy
           estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.

03:027:020 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
           field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

03:027:021 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
           unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof
           shall be the priest's.

03:027:022 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath
           bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;

03:027:023 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy
           estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall
           give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the
           LORD.

03:027:024 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
           whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the
           land did belong.

03:027:025 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of
           the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

03:027:026 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's
           firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or
           sheep: it is the LORD's.

03:027:027 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
           according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of
           it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold
           according to thy estimation.

03:027:028 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
           the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of
           the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every
           devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.

03:027:029 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be
           redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.

03:027:030 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
           land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy
           unto the LORD.

03:027:031 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall
           add thereto the fifth part thereof.

03:027:032 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
           whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto
           the LORD.

03:027:033 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall
           he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the
           change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

03:027:034 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for
           the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

Book 04        Numbers

04:001:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
           the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the
           second month, in the second year after they were come out of
           the land of Egypt, saying,

04:001:003 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go
           forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by
           their armies.

           their names:

04:001:018 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first
           day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees
           after their families, by the house of their fathers, according
           to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,

04:001:019 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the
           wilderness of Sinai.

04:001:020 And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their

           fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls,
           every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were

04:001:044 These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron
           numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each
           one was for the house of his fathers.

04:001:045 So were all those that were numbered of the children of
           Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old

04:001:046 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and
           three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

04:001:047 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not
           numbered among them.

04:001:048 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,

04:001:049 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the
           sum of them among the children of Israel:

04:001:050 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of
           testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all
           things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and
           all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and
           shall encamp round about the tabernacle.

04:001:051 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall
           take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the
           Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh
           shall be put to death.

04:001:052 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man
           by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout
           their hosts.

04:001:053 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of
           testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the
           children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of
           the tabernacle of testimony.

04:001:054 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
           commanded Moses, so did they.

04:002:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:002:002 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own
           standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off
           about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.

04:002:003 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they
           of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their
           armies: and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of
           the children of Judah.

04:002:004 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

04:002:005 And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of
           Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of
           the children of Issachar.

04:002:007 Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon shall be
           captain of the children of Zebulun.

04:002:008 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
           and seven thousand and four hundred.

04:002:009 All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred
           thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four
           hundred, throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.

04:002:010 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben
           according to their armies: and the captain of the children of
           Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

04:002:011 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty
           and six thousand and five hundred.

04:002:012 And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and
           the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the
           son of Zurishaddai.

           shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

04:002:015 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty

           thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and
           fifty, throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in
           the second rank.

04:002:017 Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with
           the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they
           encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by
           their standards.

04:002:018 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim
           according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of
           Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

04:002:019 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
           thousand and five hundred.

04:002:020 And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the captain of
           the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of
           Pedahzur.

04:002:021 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

04:002:022 Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of
           Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.

04:002:023 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

04:002:024 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred
           thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their
           armies. And they shall go forward in the third rank.

04:002:025 The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by
           their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan shall be
           Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

04:002:026 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
           threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

04:002:027 And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher: and
           the captain of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son
           of Ocran.

04:002:028 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
           and one thousand and five hundred.

04:002:029 Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the captain of the children of
           Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.

04:002:030 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
           and three thousand and four hundred.

04:002:031 All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred
           thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They
           shall go hindmost with their standards.

04:002:032 These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel
           by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of
           the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and
           three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

04:002:033 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of
           Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

04:002:034 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
           commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so
           they set forward, every one after their families, according to
           the house of their fathers.

04:003:001 These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day
           that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

04:003:002 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the
           firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

04:003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which
           were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's
           office.

04:003:004 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered
           strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and
           they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in
           the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.

04:003:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:003:006 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron
           the priest, that they may minister unto him.

04:003:007 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
           congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do
           the service of the tabernacle.

04:003:008 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of
           the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to
           do the service of the tabernacle.

04:003:009 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons:
           they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

04:003:010 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait
           on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh
           shall be put to death.

04:003:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:003:012 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the
           children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth
           the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites
           shall be mine;

04:003:013 Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I
           smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto
           me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall
           they be: I am the LORD.

04:003:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,
           saying,

04:003:015 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers,
           by their families: every male from a month old and upward
           shalt thou number them.

04:003:016 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as
           he was commanded.

04:003:017 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and
           Kohath, and Merari.

04:003:018 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their
           families; Libni, and Shimei.

04:003:019 And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar,
           Hebron, and Uzziel.

04:003:020 And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi.
           These are the families of the Levites according to the house
           of their fathers.

04:003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of
           the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.

04:003:022 Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of
           all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that
           were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.

04:003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the
           tabernacle westward.

04:003:024 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites
           shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.

04:003:025 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the
           congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the
           covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation,

04:003:026 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of
           the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round
           about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.

04:003:027 And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family
           of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the
           family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the
           Kohathites.

04:003:028 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
           were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the
           sanctuary.

04:003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of
           the tabernacle southward.

04:003:030 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
           the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

04:003:031 And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the
           candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary
           wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service
           thereof.

04:003:032 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over
           the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that
           keep the charge of the sanctuary.

04:003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of
           the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

04:003:034 And those that were numbered of them, according to the number
           of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six
           thousand and two hundred.

04:003:035 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
           Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the
           side of the tabernacle northward.

04:003:036 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall
           be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the
           pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels
           thereof, and all that serveth thereto,

04:003:037 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
           and their pins, and their cords.

04:003:038 But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east,
           even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall
           be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the
           sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the
           stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

04:003:039 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron
           numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their
           families, all the males from a month old and upward, were
           twenty and two thousand.

04:003:040 And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the
           males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward,
           and take the number of their names.

04:003:041 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead
           of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the
           cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the
           cattle of the children of Israel.

04:003:042 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the
           firstborn among the children of Israel.

04:003:043 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a
           month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them,
           were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and
           thirteen.

04:003:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:003:045 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the
           children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of
           their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.

04:003:046 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
           threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of
           Israel, which are more than the Levites;

04:003:047 Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after
           the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel
           is twenty gerahs:)

04:003:048 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of
           them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

04:003:049 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and
           above them that were redeemed by the Levites:

04:003:050 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money;
           a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels,
           after the shekel of the sanctuary:

04:003:051 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron
           and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the
           LORD commanded Moses.

04:004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:004:002 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of
           Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,

04:004:003 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old,
           all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle
           of the congregation.

04:004:004 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the
           tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:

04:004:005 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his
           sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover
           the ark of testimony with it:

04:004:006 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and
           shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in
           the staves thereof.

04:004:007 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of
           blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the
           bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread
           shall be thereon:

04:004:008 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover
           the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in
           the staves thereof.

04:004:009 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick
           of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his
           snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they
           minister unto it:

04:004:010 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a
           covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

04:004:011 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue,
           and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put
           to the staves thereof:

04:004:012 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith
           they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of
           blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and
           shall put them on a bar:

04:004:013 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread
           a purple cloth thereon:

04:004:014 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith
           they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and
           the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and
           they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and
           put to the staves of it.

04:004:015 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
           sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp
           is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come
           to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they
           die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the
           tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:016 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
           pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and
           the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the
           oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is,
           in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.

04:004:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,

04:004:018 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites
           from among the Levites:

04:004:019 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when
           they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons
           shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to
           his burden:

04:004:020 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are
           covered, lest they die.

04:004:021 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:004:022 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the
           houses of their fathers, by their families;

04:004:023 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt
           thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to
           do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to
           serve, and for burdens:

04:004:025 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
           tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering
           of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging
           for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,

04:004:026 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of
           the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the
           altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of
           their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they
           serve.

04:004:027 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the
           service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens,
           and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in
           charge all their burdens.

04:004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in
           the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be
           under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

04:004:029 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
           families, by the house of their fathers;

04:004:030 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old
           shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the
           service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:031 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
           service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of
           the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof,
           and sockets thereof,

04:004:032 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
           and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,
           and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the
           instruments of the charge of their burden.

04:004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
           according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the
           priest.

04:004:034 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered
           the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the
           house of their fathers,

04:004:035 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
           tabernacle of the congregation:

04:004:036 And those that were numbered of them by their families were
           two thousand seven hundred and fifty.

04:004:037 These were they that were numbered of the families of the
           Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
           congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to
           the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

04:004:038 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon,
           throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,

04:004:039 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
           tabernacle of the congregation,

04:004:040 Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their
           families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and
           six hundred and thirty.

04:004:041 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons
           of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of
           the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to
           the commandment of the LORD.

04:004:042 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
           Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their
           fathers,

04:004:043 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
           tabernacle of the congregation,

04:004:044 Even those that were numbered of them after their families,
           were three thousand and two hundred.

04:004:045 These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons
           of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word
           of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

04:004:046 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and
           Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families,
           and after the house of their fathers,

04:004:047 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
           every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the
           service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:004:048 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and
           five hundred and fourscore,

04:004:049 According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by
           the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and
           according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as
           the LORD commanded Moses.

04:005:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:005:002 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp
           every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever
           is defiled by the dead:

04:005:003 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall
           ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst
           whereof I dwell.

04:005:004 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without
           the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of
           Israel.

04:005:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:005:006 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall
           commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the
           LORD, and that person be guilty;

04:005:007 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he
           shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and
           add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him
           against whom he hath trespassed.

04:005:008 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass
           unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to
           the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an
           atonement shall be made for him.

04:005:009 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of
           Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

04:005:010 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any
           man giveth the priest, it shall be his.

04:005:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:005:012 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
           man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,

04:005:013 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes
           of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and
           there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the
           manner;

04:005:014 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of
           his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy
           come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not
           defiled:

04:005:015 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he
           shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah
           of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put
           frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an
           offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

04:005:016 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the
           LORD:

04:005:017 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and
           of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest
           shall take, and put it into the water:

04:005:018 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and
           uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in
           her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest
           shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the
           curse:

04:005:019 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the
           woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not
           gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband,
           be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:

04:005:020 But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband,
           and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee
           beside thine husband:

04:005:021 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of
           cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD
           make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD
           doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;

04:005:022 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy
           bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And
           the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

04:005:023 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he
           shall blot them out with the bitter water:

04:005:024 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that
           causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall
           enter into her, and become bitter.

04:005:025 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
           woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and
           offer it upon the altar:

04:005:026 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the
           memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward
           shall cause the woman to drink the water.

04:005:027 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall
           come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass
           against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse
           shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall
           swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse
           among her people.

04:005:028 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall
           be free, and shall conceive seed.

04:005:029 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to
           another instead of her husband, and is defiled;

04:005:030 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be
           jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the
           LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

04:005:031 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman
           shall bear her iniquity.

04:006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:006:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When
           either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of
           a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD:

04:006:003 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and
           shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink,
           neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist
           grapes, or dried.

04:006:004 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is
           made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

04:006:005 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor
           come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which
           he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and
           shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.

04:006:006 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall
           come at no dead body.

04:006:007 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
           mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die:
           because the consecration of his God is upon his head.

04:006:008 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.

04:006:009 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled
           the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in
           the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave
           it.

04:006:010 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
           pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
           congregation:

04:006:011 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
           other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for
           that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that
           same day.

04:006:012 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his
           separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a
           trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be
           lost, because his separation was defiled.

04:006:013 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
           separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation:

04:006:014 And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of
           the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one
           ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering,
           and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,

04:006:015 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled
           with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil,
           and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.

04:006:016 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall
           offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:

04:006:017 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings
           unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest
           shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.

04:006:018 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the
           door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the
           hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire
           which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

04:006:019 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and
           one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened
           wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite,
           after the hair of his separation is shaven:

04:006:020 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the
           LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and
           heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

04:006:021 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his
           offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that
           his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he
           must do after the law of his separation.

04:006:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:006:023 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye
           shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

04:006:024 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:

04:006:025 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
           thee:

04:006:026 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee
           peace.

04:006:027 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I
           will bless them.

04:007:001 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
           tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all
           the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels
           thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;

04:007:002 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their
           fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over
           them that were numbered, offered:

04:007:003 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered
           wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and
           for each one an ox: and they brought them before the
           tabernacle.

04:007:004 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:007:005 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the
           tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto
           the Levites, to every man according to his service.

04:007:006 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
           Levites.

04:007:007 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,
           according to their service:

04:007:008 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of
           Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of
           Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

04:007:009 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service
           of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear
           upon their shoulders.

04:007:010 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day
           that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering
           before the altar.

04:007:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering,
           each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

04:007:012 And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the
           son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:

04:007:089 And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the
           congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one
           speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the
           ark of testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake
           unto him.

04:008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:008:002 Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, When thou lightest the
           lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the
           candlestick.

04:008:003 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against
           the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.

04:008:004 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the
           shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work:
           according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so
           he made the candlestick.

04:008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:008:006 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and
           cleanse them.

04:008:007 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle
           water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their
           flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves
           clean.

04:008:008 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering,
           even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock
           shalt thou take for a sin offering.

04:008:009 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
           congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the
           children of Israel together:

04:008:010 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the
           children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

04:008:011 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an
           offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the
           service of the LORD.

04:008:012 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
           bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and
           the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an
           atonement for the Levites.

04:008:013 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his
           sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.

04:008:014 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children
           of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.

04:008:015 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of
           the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse
           them, and offer them for an offering.

04:008:016 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
           Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of
           the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them
           unto me.

04:008:017 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both
           man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the
           land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

04:008:018 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
           children of Israel.

04:008:019 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his
           sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of
           the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation,
           and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that
           there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the
           children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

04:008:020 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children
           of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD
           commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of
           Israel unto them.

04:008:021 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes;
           and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and
           Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.

04:008:022 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
           tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his
           sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
           so did they unto them.

04:008:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:008:024 This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and
           five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the
           service of the tabernacle of the congregation:

04:008:025 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon
           the service thereof, and shall serve no more:

04:008:026 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of
           the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.
           Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.

04:009:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
           the first month of the second year after they were come out of
           the land of Egypt, saying,

04:009:002 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his
           appointed season.

04:009:003 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it
           in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and
           according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

04:009:004 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should
           keep the passover.

04:009:005 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
           month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all
           that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

04:009:006 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body
           of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day:
           and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:

04:009:007 And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body
           of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an
           offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the
           children of Israel?

04:009:008 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what
           the LORD will command concerning you.

04:009:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:009:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you
           or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead
           body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the
           passover unto the LORD.

04:009:011 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
           it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

04:009:012 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any
           bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover
           they shall keep it.

04:009:013 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and
           forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be
           cut off from among his people: because he brought not the
           offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall
           bear his sin.

04:009:014 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
           passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the
           passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do:
           ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for
           him that was born in the land.

04:009:015 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
           covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and
           at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the
           appearance of fire, until the morning.

04:009:016 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the
           appearance of fire by night.

04:009:017 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then
           after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place
           where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched
           their tents.

04:009:018 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel
           journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as
           long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in
           their tents.

04:009:019 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
           then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and
           journeyed not.

04:009:020 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the
           tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they
           abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the
           LORD they journeyed.

04:009:021 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the
           morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then
           they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the
           cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

04:009:022 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the
           cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the
           children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not:
           but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

04:009:023 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and
           at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the
           charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand
           of Moses.

04:010:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:010:002 Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou
           make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the
           assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.

04:010:003 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall
           assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of
           the congregation.

04:010:004 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which
           are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves
           unto thee.

04:010:005 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east
           parts shall go forward.

04:010:006 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie
           on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an
           alarm for their journeys.

04:010:007 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall
           blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

04:010:008 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the
           trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever
           throughout your generations.

04:010:009 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
           oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets;
           and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye
           shall be saved from your enemies.

04:010:010 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and
           in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the
           trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of
           your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial
           before your God: I am the LORD your God.

04:010:011 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month,
           in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the
           tabernacle of the testimony.

04:010:012 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
           wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of
           Paran.

04:010:013 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
           of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

04:010:014 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the
           children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host
           was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

04:010:015 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
           Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

04:010:016 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was
           Eliab the son of Helon.

04:010:017 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and
           the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

04:010:018 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according
           to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of
           Shedeur.

04:010:019 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
           Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

04:010:020 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
           Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

04:010:021 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the
           other did set up the tabernacle against they came.

04:010:022 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set
           forward according to their armies: and over his host was
           Elishama the son of Ammihud.

04:010:023 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
           Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

04:010:024 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
           Abidan the son of Gideoni.

04:010:025 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set
           forward, which was the rereward of all the camps throughout
           their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of
           Ammishaddai.

04:010:026 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was
           Pagiel the son of Ocran.

04:010:027 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
           Ahira the son of Enan.

04:010:028 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according
           to their armies, when they set forward.

04:010:029 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
           Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of
           which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us,
           and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good
           concerning Israel.

04:010:030 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
           own land, and to my kindred.

04:010:031 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
           knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou
           mayest be to us instead of eyes.

04:010:032 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that
           what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do
           unto thee.

04:010:033 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'
           journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before
           them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place
           for them.

04:010:034 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went
           out of the camp.

04:010:035 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses
           said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and
           let them that hate thee flee before thee.

04:010:036 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
           thousands of Israel.

04:011:001 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and
           the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of
           the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the
           uttermost parts of the camp.

04:011:002 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto
           the LORD, the fire was quenched.

04:011:003 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire
           of the LORD burnt among them.

04:011:004 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
           the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall
           give us flesh to eat?

04:011:005 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
           cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and
           the garlick:

04:011:006 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all,
           beside this manna, before our eyes.

04:011:007 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
           the colour of bdellium.

04:011:008 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
           mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made
           cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh
           oil.

04:011:009 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna
           fell upon it.

04:011:010 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
           every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD
           was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.

04:011:011 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted
           thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy
           sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?

04:011:012 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that
           thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a
           nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which
           thou swarest unto their fathers?

04:011:013 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for
           they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

04:011:014 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
           heavy for me.

04:011:015 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
           hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see
           my wretchedness.

04:011:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of
           the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of
           the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the
           tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with
           thee.

04:011:017 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
           of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them;
           and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that
           thou bear it not thyself alone.

04:011:018 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
           morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears
           of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it
           was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you
           flesh, and ye shall eat.

04:011:019 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
           ten days, nor twenty days;

04:011:020 But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils,
           and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised
           the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying,
           Why came we forth out of Egypt?

04:011:021 And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
           thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh,
           that they may eat a whole month.

04:011:022 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
           them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together
           for them, to suffice them?

04:011:023 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short?
           thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto
           thee or not.

04:011:024 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
           and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and
           set them round about the tabernacle.

04:011:025 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and
           took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the
           seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit
           rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.

04:011:026 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
           one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit
           rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but
           went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the
           camp.

04:011:027 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
           Medad do prophesy in the camp.

04:011:028 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
           young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

04:011:029 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
           that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD
           would put his spirit upon them!

04:011:030 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

04:011:031 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
           from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a
           day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on
           the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two
           cubits high upon the face of the earth.

04:011:032 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
           all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that
           gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all
           abroad for themselves round about the camp.

04:011:033 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
           chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people,
           and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

04:011:034 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because
           there they buried the people that lusted.

04:011:035 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
           and abode at Hazeroth.

04:012:001 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the
           Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an
           Ethiopian woman.

04:012:002 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath
           he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.

04:012:003 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
           upon the face of the earth.)

04:012:004 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and
           unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the
           congregation. And they three came out.

04:012:005 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood
           in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam:
           and they both came forth.

04:012:006 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among
           you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision,
           and will speak unto him in a dream.

04:012:007 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

04:012:008 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not
           in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he
           behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
           servant Moses?

04:012:009 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he
           departed.

04:012:010 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
           Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon
           Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.

04:012:011 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay
           not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and
           wherein we have sinned.

04:012:012 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
           when he cometh out of his mother's womb.

04:012:013 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
           beseech thee.

04:012:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in
           her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be
           shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be
           received in again.

04:012:015 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the
           people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

04:012:016 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in
           the wilderness of Paran.

04:013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:013:002 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which
           I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their
           fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.

04:013:003 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
           wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children
           of Israel.

04:013:004 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua
           the son of Zaccur.

04:013:005 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

04:013:006 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

04:013:007 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

04:013:008 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

04:013:009 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

04:013:010 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

04:013:011 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh,
           Gaddi the son of Susi.

04:013:012 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

04:013:013 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

04:013:014 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

04:013:015 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

04:013:016 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
           land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

04:013:017 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said
           unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the
           mountain:

04:013:018 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth
           therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;

04:013:019 And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or
           bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in
           tents, or in strong holds;

04:013:020 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there
           be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring
           of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the
           firstripe grapes.

04:013:021 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of
           Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

04:013:022 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
           Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now
           Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

04:013:023 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from
           thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it
           between two upon a staff; and they brought of the
           pomegranates, and of the figs.

04:013:024 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster
           of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

04:013:025 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

04:013:026 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
           congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of
           Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto
           all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

04:013:027 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither
           thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey;
           and this is the fruit of it.

04:013:028 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and
           the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the
           children of Anak there.

04:013:029 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the
           Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the
           mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the
           coast of Jordan.

04:013:030 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go
           up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome
           it.

04:013:031 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go
           up against the people; for they are stronger than we.

04:013:032 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
           searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land,
           through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth
           up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in
           it are men of a great stature.

04:013:033 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of
           the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and
           so we were in their sight.

04:014:001 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
           the people wept that night.

04:014:002 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and
           against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them,
           Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God
           we had died in this wilderness!

04:014:003 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall
           by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a
           prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?

04:014:004 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let
           us return into Egypt.

04:014:005 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the
           assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.

04:014:006 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
           which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:

04:014:007 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,
           saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an
           exceeding good land.

04:014:008 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this
           land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and
           honey.

04:014:009 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people
           of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is
           departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.

04:014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the
           glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the
           congregation before all the children of Israel.

04:014:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people
           provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for
           all the signs which I have shewed among them?

04:014:012 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,
           and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

04:014:013 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear
           it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from
           among them;)

04:014:014 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for
           they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that
           thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth
           over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a
           pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

04:014:015 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the
           nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

04:014:016 Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the
           land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in
           the wilderness.

04:014:017 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
           according as thou hast spoken, saying,

04:014:018 The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving
           iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the
           guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
           unto the third and fourth generation.

04:014:019 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according
           unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven
           this people, from Egypt even until now.

04:014:020 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:

04:014:021 But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the
           glory of the LORD.

04:014:022 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my
           miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have
           tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my
           voice;

04:014:023 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their
           fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

04:014:024 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him,
           and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land
           whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.

04:014:025 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
           Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way
           of the Red sea.

04:014:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:014:027 How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which
           murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children
           of Israel, which they murmur against me.

04:014:028 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have
           spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:

04:014:029 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were
           numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty
           years old and upward which have murmured against me.

04:014:030 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I
           sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of
           Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

04:014:031 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them
           will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have
           despised.

04:014:032 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
           wilderness.

04:014:033 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
           and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the
           wilderness.

04:014:034 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
           even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your
           iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of
           promise.

04:014:035 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
           congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this
           wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

04:014:036 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who
           returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him,
           by bringing up a slander upon the land,

04:014:037 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the
           land, died by the plague before the LORD.

04:014:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
           which were of the men that went to search the land, lived
           still.

04:014:039 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:
           and the people mourned greatly.

04:014:040 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into
           the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go
           up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have
           sinned.

04:014:041 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
           of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.

04:014:042 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not
           smitten before your enemies.

04:014:043 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you,
           and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away
           from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.

04:014:044 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
           ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out
           of the camp.

04:014:045 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt
           in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto
           Hormah.

04:015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto
           you,

04:015:003 And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt
           offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill
           offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour
           unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:

04:015:004 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a
           meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth
           part of an hin of oil.

04:015:005 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering
           shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for
           one lamb.

04:015:006 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
           deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

04:015:007 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
           hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

04:015:008 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for
           a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the
           LORD:

04:015:009 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three
           tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

04:015:010 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,
           for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

04:015:011 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for
           a lamb, or a kid.

04:015:012 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do
           to every one according to their number.

04:015:013 All that are born of the country shall do these things after
           this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet
           savour unto the LORD.

04:015:014 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you
           in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire,
           of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

04:015:015 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and
           also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance
           for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger
           be before the LORD.

04:015:016 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger
           that sojourneth with you.

04:015:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:015:018 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           come into the land whither I bring you,

04:015:019 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land,
           ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

04:015:020 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an
           heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the
           threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.

04:015:021 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an
           heave offering in your generations.

04:015:022 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
           which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,

04:015:023 Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of
           Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and
           henceforward among your generations;

04:015:024 Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without
           the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation
           shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a
           sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his
           drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the
           goats for a sin offering.

04:015:025 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the
           congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be
           forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their
           offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their
           sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:

04:015:026 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children
           of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing
           all the people were in ignorance.

04:015:027 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a
           she goat of the first year for a sin offering.

04:015:028 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that
           sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the
           LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven
           him.

04:015:029 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,
           both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and
           for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

04:015:030 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be
           born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the
           LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

04:015:031 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken
           his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his
           iniquity shall be upon him.

04:015:032 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they
           found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

04:015:033 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto
           Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

04:015:034 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what
           should be done to him.

04:015:035 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to
           death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones
           without the camp.

04:015:036 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and
           stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

04:015:037 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:015:038 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make
           them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their
           generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders
           a ribband of blue:

04:015:039 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon
           it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do
           them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own
           eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:

04:015:040 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy
           unto your God.

04:015:041 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
           Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

04:016:001 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
           Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the
           son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:

04:016:002 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of
           Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous
           in the congregation, men of renown:

04:016:003 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and
           against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you,
           seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and
           the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
           above the congregation of the LORD?

04:016:004 And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:

04:016:005 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even
           to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and
           will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath
           chosen will he cause to come near unto him.

04:016:006 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

04:016:007 And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD
           to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth
           choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons
           of Levi.

04:016:008 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:

04:016:009 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
           hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring
           you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the
           LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto
           them?

04:016:010 And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the
           sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

04:016:011 For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered
           together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur
           against him?

04:016:012 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab:
           which said, We will not come up:

04:016:013 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land
           that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the
           wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over
           us?

04:016:014 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth
           with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and
           vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will
           not come up.

04:016:015 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not
           thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them,
           neither have I hurt one of them.

04:016:016 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before
           the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

04:016:017 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and
           bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and
           fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.

04:016:018 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and
           laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle
           of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.

04:016:019 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
           door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of
           the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.

04:016:020 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:016:021 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
           consume them in a moment.

04:016:022 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of
           the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be
           wroth with all the congregation?

04:016:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:016:024 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
           tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

04:016:025 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
           elders of Israel followed him.

04:016:026 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray
           you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of
           their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.

04:016:027 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
           Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and
           stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their
           sons, and their little children.

04:016:028 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent
           me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own
           mind.

04:016:029 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
           visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath
           not sent me.

04:016:030 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her
           mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them,
           and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand
           that these men have provoked the LORD.

04:016:031 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all
           these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under
           them:

04:016:032 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and
           their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and
           all their goods.

04:016:033 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into
           the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished
           from among the congregation.

04:016:034 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
           them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

04:016:035 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two
           hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

04:016:036 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:016:037 Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take
           up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire
           yonder; for they are hallowed.

04:016:038 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them
           make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they
           offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and
           they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.

04:016:039 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they
           that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates
           for a covering of the altar:

04:016:040 To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no
           stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to
           offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as
           his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.

04:016:041 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of
           Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye
           have killed the people of the LORD.

04:016:042 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered
           against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the
           tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered
           it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.

04:016:043 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

04:016:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:016:045 Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume
           them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

04:016:046 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein
           from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto
           the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is
           wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.

04:016:047 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of
           the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the
           people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the
           people.

04:016:048 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague
           was stayed.

04:016:049 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
           seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of
           Korah.

04:016:050 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle
           of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

04:017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:017:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of
           them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all
           their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve
           rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.

04:017:003 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for
           one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

04:017:004 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the
           congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

04:017:005 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall
           choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the
           murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur
           against you.

04:017:006 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of
           their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one,
           according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the
           rod of Aaron was among their rods.

04:017:007 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle
           of witness.

04:017:008 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
           tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the
           house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed
           blossoms, and yielded almonds.

04:017:009 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto
           all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every
           man his rod.

04:017:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before
           the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and
           thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they
           die not.

04:017:011 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

04:017:012 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold,
           we die, we perish, we all perish.

04:017:013 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the
           LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

04:018:001 And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy
           father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the
           sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the
           iniquity of your priesthood.

04:018:002 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy
           father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto
           thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee
           shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.

04:018:003 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the
           tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the
           sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

04:018:004 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
           tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the
           tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

04:018:005 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge
           of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the
           children of Israel.

04:018:006 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from
           among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift
           for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the
           congregation.

04:018:007 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's
           office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and
           ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as
           a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be
           put to death.

04:018:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee
           the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things
           of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by
           reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for
           ever.

04:018:009 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the
           fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of
           their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass
           offering of their's which they shall render unto me, shall be
           most holy for thee and for thy sons.

04:018:010 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat
           it: it shall be holy unto thee.

04:018:011 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all
           the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given
           them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with
           thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy
           house shall eat of it.

04:018:012 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of
           the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto
           the LORD, them have I given thee.

04:018:013 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall
           bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean
           in thine house shall eat of it.

04:018:014 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.

04:018:015 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they
           bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be
           thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely
           redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.

04:018:016 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
           redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five
           shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty
           gerahs.

04:018:017 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or
           the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy:
           thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn
           their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour
           unto the LORD.

04:018:018 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and
           as the right shoulder are thine.

04:018:019 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children
           of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons
           and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a
           covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy
           seed with thee.

04:018:020 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance
           in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I
           am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of
           Israel.

04:018:021 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth
           in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they
           serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

04:018:022 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
           tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.

04:018:023 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be
           a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the
           children of Israel they have no inheritance.

04:018:024 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as
           an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites
           to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the
           children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

04:018:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:018:026 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take
           of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you
           from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an
           heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the
           tithe.

04:018:027 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as
           though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the
           fulness of the winepress.

04:018:028 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of
           all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel;
           and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron
           the priest.

04:018:029 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of
           the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part
           thereof out of it.

04:018:030 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the
           best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the
           Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the
           increase of the winepress.

04:018:031 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households:
           for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of
           the congregation.

04:018:032 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved
           from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy
           things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.

04:019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

04:019:002 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath
           commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that
           they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no
           blemish, and upon which never came yoke:

04:019:003 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may
           bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her
           before his face:

04:019:004 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his
           finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the
           tabernacle of the congregation seven times:

04:019:005 And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her
           flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:

04:019:006 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet,
           and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

04:019:007 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his
           flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and
           the priest shall be unclean until the even.

04:019:008 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and
           bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

04:019:009 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the
           heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and
           it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of
           Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for
           sin.

04:019:010 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
           clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto
           the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth
           among them, for a statute for ever.

04:019:011 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean
           seven days.

04:019:012 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the
           seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself
           the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

04:019:013 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
           purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD;
           and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water
           of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean;
           his uncleanness is yet upon him.

04:019:014 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come
           into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean
           seven days.

04:019:015 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it,
           is unclean.

04:019:016 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
           open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave,
           shall be unclean seven days.

04:019:017 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the
           burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall
           be put thereto in a vessel:

04:019:018 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water,
           and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and
           upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a
           bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:

04:019:019 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the
           third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he
           shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself
           in water, and shall be clean at even.

04:019:020 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify
           himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the
           congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the
           LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon
           him; he is unclean.

04:019:021 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
           sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and
           he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean
           until even.

04:019:022 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean;
           and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

04:020:001 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
           into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people
           abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.

04:020:002 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
           themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

04:020:003 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
           that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!

04:020:004 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into
           this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?

04:020:005 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to
           bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or
           of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any
           water to drink.

04:020:006 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly
           unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they
           fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto
           them.

04:020:007 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:020:008 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and
           Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their
           eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring
           forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the
           congregation and their beasts drink.

04:020:009 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded
           him.

04:020:010 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
           the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we
           fetch you water out of this rock?

04:020:011 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the
           rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the
           congregation drank, and their beasts also.

04:020:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed
           me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
           therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land
           which I have given them.

04:020:013 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
           strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

04:020:014 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
           Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail
           that hath befallen us:

04:020:015 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in
           Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our
           fathers:

04:020:016 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent
           an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold,
           we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:

04:020:017 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not
           pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither
           will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the
           king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the
           left, until we have passed thy borders.

04:020:018 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come
           out against thee with the sword.

04:020:019 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the
           high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I
           will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go
           through on my feet.

04:020:020 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out
           against him with much people, and with a strong hand.

04:020:021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
           wherefore Israel turned away from him.

04:020:022 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
           journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

04:020:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
           coast of the land of Edom, saying,

04:020:024 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not
           enter into the land which I have given unto the children of
           Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of
           Meribah.

04:020:025 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount
           Hor:

04:020:026 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his
           son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall
           die there.

04:020:027 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into
           mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

04:020:028 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
           Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount:
           and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

04:020:029 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they
           mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

04:021:001 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,
           heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he
           fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

04:021:002 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
           indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly
           destroy their cities.

04:021:003 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered
           up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their
           cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.

04:021:004 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea,
           to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was
           much discouraged because of the way.

04:021:005 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
           have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?
           for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our
           soul loatheth this light bread.

04:021:006 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they
           bit the people; and much people of Israel died.

04:021:007 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,
           for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray
           unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And
           Moses prayed for the people.

04:021:008 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and
           set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one
           that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

04:021:009 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and
           it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he
           beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

04:021:010 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

04:021:011 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in
           the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

04:021:012 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

04:021:013 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
           Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the
           coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab,
           between Moab and the Amorites.

04:021:014 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
           he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,

04:021:015 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the
           dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.

04:021:016 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof
           the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I
           will give them water.

04:021:017 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto
           it:

04:021:018 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged
           it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And
           from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:

04:021:019 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:

04:021:020 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab,
           to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

04:021:021 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
           saying,

04:021:022 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the
           fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters
           of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way,
           until we be past thy borders.

04:021:023 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:
           but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out
           against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and
           fought against Israel.

04:021:024 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
           his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of
           Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.

04:021:025 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
           cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages
           thereof.

04:021:026 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites,
           who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all
           his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.

04:021:027 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
           let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:

04:021:028 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city
           of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the
           high places of Arnon.

04:021:029 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he
           hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into
           captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.

04:021:030 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
           we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto
           Medeba.

04:021:031 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

04:021:032 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
           thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

04:021:033 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
           king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people,
           to the battle at Edrei.

04:021:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have
           delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land;
           and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
           Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

04:021:035 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until
           there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

04:022:001 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the
           plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

04:022:002 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to
           the Amorites.

04:022:003 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were
           many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of
           Israel.

04:022:004 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this
           company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh
           up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was
           king of the Moabites at that time.

04:022:005 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
           Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of
           his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people
           come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth,
           and they abide over against me:

04:022:006 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for
           they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that
           we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land:
           for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom
           thou cursest is cursed.

04:022:007 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with
           the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto
           Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

04:022:008 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
           you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the
           princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

04:022:009 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with
           thee?

04:022:010 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of
           Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,

04:022:011 Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth
           the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I
           shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.

04:022:012 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
           shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.

04:022:013 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes
           of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to
           give me leave to go with you.

04:022:014 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
           said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

04:022:015 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable
           than they.

04:022:016 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the
           son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from
           coming unto me:

04:022:017 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do
           whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee,
           curse me this people.

04:022:018 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
           Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
           cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or
           more.

04:022:019 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that
           I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.

04:022:020 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the
           men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the
           word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

04:022:021 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
           went with the princes of Moab.

04:022:022 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of
           the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he
           was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.

04:022:023 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
           his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of
           the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to
           turn her into the way.

04:022:024 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
           wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

04:022:025 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
           unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and
           he smote her again.

04:022:026 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
           place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to
           the left.

04:022:027 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down
           under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the
           ass with a staff.

04:022:028 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
           Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me
           these three times?

04:022:029 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I
           would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill
           thee.

04:022:030 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which
           thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I
           ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

04:022:031 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel
           of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his
           hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.

04:022:032 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
           smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to
           withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:

04:022:033 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times:
           unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain
           thee, and saved her alive.

04:022:034 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for
           I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now
           therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.

04:022:035 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men:
           but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou
           shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

04:022:036 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
           him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon,
           which is in the utmost coast.

04:022:037 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
           to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able
           indeed to promote thee to honour?

04:022:038 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I
           now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God
           putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.

04:022:039 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

04:022:040 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to
           the princes that were with him.

04:022:041 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
           brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he
           might see the utmost part of the people.

04:023:001 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
           prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.

04:023:002 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam
           offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.

04:023:003 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I
           will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and
           whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an
           high place.

04:023:004 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared
           seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock
           and a ram.

04:023:005 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return
           unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

04:023:006 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt
           sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.

04:023:007 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab
           hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,
           saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

04:023:008 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I
           defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?

04:023:009 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I
           behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
           reckoned among the nations.

04:023:010 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
           part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let
           my last end be like his!

04:023:011 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I
           took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast
           blessed them altogether.

04:023:012 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that
           which the LORD hath put in my mouth?

04:023:013 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto
           another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt
           see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all:
           and curse me them from thence.

04:023:014 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
           Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a
           ram on every altar.

04:023:015 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering,
           while I meet the LORD yonder.

04:023:016 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and
           said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.

04:023:017 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt
           offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said
           unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?

04:023:018 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and
           hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

04:023:019 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man,
           that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?
           or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

04:023:020 Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath
           blessed; and I cannot reverse it.

04:023:021 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
           perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the
           shout of a king is among them.

04:023:022 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
           of an unicorn.

04:023:023 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there
           any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall
           be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

04:023:024 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up
           himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of
           the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

04:023:025 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor
           bless them at all.

04:023:026 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
           saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?

04:023:027 And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring
           thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that
           thou mayest curse me them from thence.

04:023:028 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
           toward Jeshimon.

04:023:029 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
           prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

04:023:030 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a
           ram on every altar.

04:024:001 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel,
           he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but
           he set his face toward the wilderness.

04:024:002 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in
           his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God
           came upon him.

04:024:003 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
           hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

04:024:004 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the
           vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his
           eyes open:

04:024:005 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O
           Israel!

04:024:006 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the
           river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath
           planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.

04:024:007 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall
           be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and
           his kingdom shall be exalted.

04:024:008 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
           strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his
           enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through
           with his arrows.

04:024:009 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who
           shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and
           cursed is he that curseth thee.

04:024:010 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his
           hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to
           curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed
           them these three times.

04:024:011 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote
           thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back
           from honour.

04:024:012 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
           which thou sentest unto me, saying,

04:024:013 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
           cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either
           good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that
           will I speak?

04:024:014 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I
           will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in
           the latter days.

04:024:015 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
           hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

04:024:016 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the
           knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the
           Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:

04:024:017 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not
           nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre
           shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,
           and destroy all the children of Sheth.

04:024:018 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a
           possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

04:024:019 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
           destroy him that remaineth of the city.

04:024:020 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and
           said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end
           shall be that he perish for ever.

04:024:021 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and
           said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest
           in a rock.

04:024:022 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall
           carry thee away captive.

04:024:023 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live
           when God doeth this!

04:024:024 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall
           afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall
           perish for ever.

04:024:025 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and
           Balak also went his way.

04:025:001 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit
           whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

04:025:002 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods:
           and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

04:025:003 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the
           LORD was kindled against Israel.

04:025:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the
           people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that
           the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.

04:025:005 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one
           his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.

04:025:006 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought
           unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses,
           and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of
           Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of
           the congregation.

04:025:007 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the
           priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and
           took a javelin in his hand;

04:025:008 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust
           both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through
           her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of
           Israel.

04:025:009 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four
           thousand.

04:025:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:025:011 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
           hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while
           he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the
           children of Israel in my jealousy.

04:025:012 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

04:025:013 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the
           covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous
           for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.

04:025:014 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was
           slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu,
           a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.

04:025:015 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was
           Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of
           a chief house in Midian.

04:025:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:025:017 Vex the Midianites, and smite them:

04:025:018 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have
           beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of
           Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which
           was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.

04:026:001 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto
           Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

04:026:002 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of
           Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their
           fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.

04:026:003 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains
           of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

04:026:004 Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward;
           as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which
           went forth out of the land of Egypt.

04:026:005 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben;

           that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation,
           who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of
           Korah, when they strove against the LORD:

04:026:010 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together
           with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire
           devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.

04:026:011 Notwithstanding the children of Korah died not.

04:026:052 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:026:053 Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance
           according to the number of names.

04:026:054 To many thou shalt give the more inheritance, and to few thou
           shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his
           inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of
           him.

04:026:055 Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to
           the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit.

04:026:056 According to the lot shall the possession thereof be divided
           between many and few.

           Kohath, the family of the Kohathites: of Merari, the family of

04:026:059 And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of
           Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto
           Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.

04:026:060 And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
           Ithamar.

04:026:061 And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire
           before the LORD.

04:026:062 And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three
           thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were
           not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was
           no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.

04:026:063 These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the
           priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of
           Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

04:026:064 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and
           Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of
           Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

04:026:065 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the
           wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb
           the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

04:027:001 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the
           son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
           families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the
           names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah,
           and Tirzah.

04:027:002 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,
           and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door
           of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

04:027:003 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the
           company of them that gathered themselves together against the
           LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had
           no sons.

04:027:004 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
           family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a
           possession among the brethren of our father.

04:027:005 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.

04:027:006 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:027:007 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely
           give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's
           brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father
           to pass unto them.

04:027:008 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a
           man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance
           to pass unto his daughter.

04:027:009 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance
           unto his brethren.

04:027:010 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance
           unto his father's brethren.

04:027:011 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
           inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his
           family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the
           children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD
           commanded Moses.

04:027:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount
           Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children
           of Israel.

04:027:013 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto
           thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.

04:027:014 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin,
           in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water
           before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in
           the wilderness of Zin.

04:027:015 And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,

04:027:016 Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man
           over the congregation,

04:027:017 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them,
           and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that
           the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no
           shepherd.

04:027:018 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun,
           a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;

04:027:019 And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
           congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

04:027:020 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the
           congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

04:027:021 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask
           counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at
           his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come
           in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all
           the congregation.

04:027:022 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua,
           and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
           congregation:

04:027:023 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the
           LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

04:028:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:028:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My
           offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a
           sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in
           their due season.

04:028:003 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by
           fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the
           first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt
           offering.

04:028:004 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other
           lamb shalt thou offer at even;

04:028:005 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering,
           mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

04:028:006 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount
           Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the
           LORD.

04:028:007 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an
           hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the
           strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

04:028:008 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat
           offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof,
           thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet
           savour unto the LORD.

04:028:009 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without
           spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering,
           mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:

04:028:010 This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the
           continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

04:028:011 And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt
           offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven
           lambs of the first year without spot;

04:028:012 And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled
           with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a
           meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;

04:028:013 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
           offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet
           savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

04:028:014 And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a
           bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth
           part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of
           every month throughout the months of the year.

04:028:015 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD
           shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his
           drink offering.

04:028:016 And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover
           of the LORD.

04:028:017 And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven
           days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

04:028:018 In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no
           manner of servile work therein:

04:028:019 But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt
           offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and
           seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without
           blemish:

04:028:020 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil:
           three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth
           deals for a ram;

04:028:021 A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb,
           throughout the seven lambs:

04:028:022 And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

04:028:023 Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning,
           which is for a continual burnt offering.

04:028:024 After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven
           days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet
           savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual
           burnt offering, and his drink offering.

04:028:025 And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye
           shall do no servile work.

04:028:026 Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat
           offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have
           an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:

04:028:027 But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
           the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the
           first year;

04:028:028 And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth
           deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,

04:028:029 A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven
           lambs;

04:028:030 And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.

04:028:031 Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and
           his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish)
           and their drink offerings.

04:029:001 And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye
           shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:
           it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.

04:029:002 And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
           the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the
           first year without blemish:

04:029:003 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
           three tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a
           ram,

04:029:004 And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

04:029:005 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an
           atonement for you:

04:029:006 Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering,
           and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their
           drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet
           savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

04:029:007 And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an
           holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall
           not do any work therein:

04:029:008 But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet
           savour; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the
           first year; they shall be unto you without blemish:

04:029:009 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
           three tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals to one
           ram,

04:029:010 A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

04:029:011 One kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the sin
           offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and
           the meat offering of it, and their drink offerings.

04:029:012 And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an
           holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall
           keep a feast unto the LORD seven days:

04:029:013 And ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire,
           of a sweet savour unto the LORD; thirteen young bullocks, two
           rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be
           without blemish:

04:029:014 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
           three tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks,
           two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams,

04:029:015 And a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs:

04:029:016 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
           continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink
           offering.

04:029:017 And on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks,
           two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without spot:

04:029:018 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:019 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
           continual burnt offering, and the meat offering thereof, and
           their drink offerings.

04:029:020 And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs
           of the first year without blemish;

04:029:021 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:022 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
           offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

04:029:023 And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
           lambs of the first year without blemish:

04:029:024 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:025 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
           continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink
           offering.

04:029:026 And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
           lambs of the first year without spot:

04:029:027 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:028 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
           offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

04:029:029 And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
           lambs of the first year without blemish:

04:029:030 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:031 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
           offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

04:029:032 And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
           lambs of the first year without blemish:

04:029:033 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
           bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
           to their number, after the manner:

04:029:034 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
           offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

04:029:035 On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do
           no servile work therein:

04:029:036 But ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire,
           of a sweet savour unto the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven
           lambs of the first year without blemish:

04:029:037 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock,
           for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their
           number, after the manner:

04:029:038 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
           offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

04:029:039 These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts,
           beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt
           offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink
           offerings, and for your peace offerings.

04:029:040 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that
           the LORD commanded Moses.

04:030:001 And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the
           children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD
           hath commanded.

04:030:002 If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his
           soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do
           according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.

04:030:003 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a
           bond, being in her father's house in her youth;

04:030:004 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath
           bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her;
           then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she
           hath bound her soul shall stand.

04:030:005 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not
           any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her
           soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her
           father disallowed her.

04:030:006 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered
           ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

04:030:007 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day
           that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds
           wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

04:030:008 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;
           then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she
           uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none
           effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.

04:030:009 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced,
           wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against
           her.

04:030:010 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by
           a bond with an oath;

04:030:011 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and
           disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every
           bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

04:030:012 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
           heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips
           concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall
           not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall
           forgive her.

04:030:013 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her
           husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

04:030:014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day
           to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds,
           which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his
           peace at her in the day that he heard them.

04:030:015 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath
           heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

04:030:016 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses,
           between a man and his wife, between the father and his
           daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.

04:031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:031:002 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward
           shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.

04:031:003 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of
           yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the
           Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.

04:031:004 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of
           Israel, shall ye send to the war.

04:031:005 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a
           thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

04:031:006 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe,
           them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war,
           with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his
           hand.

04:031:007 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded
           Moses; and they slew all the males.

04:031:008 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them
           that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and
           Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they
           slew with the sword.

04:031:009 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian
           captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all
           their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.

04:031:010 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all
           their goodly castles, with fire.

04:031:011 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and
           of beasts.

04:031:012 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil,
           unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation
           of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of
           Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.

04:031:013 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
           congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.

04:031:014 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the
           captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which
           came from the battle.

04:031:015 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

04:031:016 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the
           counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the
           matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation
           of the LORD.

04:031:017 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill
           every woman that hath known man by lying with him.

04:031:018 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying
           with him, keep alive for yourselves.

04:031:019 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath
           killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain,
           purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and
           on the seventh day.

04:031:020 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins,
           and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

04:031:021 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to
           the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD
           commanded Moses;

04:031:022 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin,
           and the lead,

04:031:023 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go
           through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall
           be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth
           not the fire ye shall make go through the water.

04:031:024 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye
           shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

04:031:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:031:026 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of
           beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of
           the congregation:

04:031:027 And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the
           war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the
           congregation:

04:031:028 And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went
           out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons,
           and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:

04:031:029 Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest,
           for an heave offering of the LORD.

04:031:030 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one
           portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses,
           and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto
           the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
           LORD.

04:031:031 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

04:031:032 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war
           had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and
           five thousand sheep,

04:031:033 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,

04:031:034 And threescore and one thousand asses,

04:031:035 And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had
           not known man by lying with him.

04:031:036 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to
           war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty
           thousand and five hundred sheep:

04:031:037 And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and
           threescore and fifteen.

04:031:038 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the
           LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve.

04:031:039 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which
           the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.

04:031:040 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's
           tribute was thirty and two persons.

04:031:041 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave
           offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

04:031:042 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from
           the men that warred,

04:031:043 (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three
           hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and
           five hundred sheep,

04:031:044 And thirty and six thousand beeves,

04:031:045 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,

04:031:046 And sixteen thousand persons;)

04:031:047 Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion
           of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the
           Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD;
           as the LORD commanded Moses.

04:031:048 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the
           captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near
           unto Moses:

04:031:049 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of
           the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh
           not one man of us.

04:031:050 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every
           man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets,
           rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our
           souls before the LORD.

04:031:051 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even
           all wrought jewels.

04:031:052 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
           LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of
           hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty
           shekels.

04:031:053 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

04:031:054 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains
           of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the
           tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the
           children of Israel before the LORD.

04:032:001 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very
           great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of
           Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a
           place for cattle;

04:032:002 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake
           unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of
           the congregation, saying,

04:032:003 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and
           Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

04:032:004 Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation
           of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:

04:032:005 Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let
           this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and
           bring us not over Jordan.

04:032:006 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
           Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?

04:032:007 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of
           Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given
           them?

04:032:008 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to
           see the land.

04:032:009 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
           land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel,
           that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given
           them.

04:032:010 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
           saying,

04:032:011 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty
           years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto
           Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not
           wholly followed me:

04:032:012 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the
           son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.

04:032:013 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
           them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the
           generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was
           consumed.

04:032:014 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an
           increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the
           LORD toward Israel.

04:032:015 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
           them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

04:032:016 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build
           sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little
           ones:

04:032:017 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of
           Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our
           little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the
           inhabitants of the land.

04:032:018 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of
           Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.

04:032:019 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
           forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side
           Jordan eastward.

04:032:020 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will
           go armed before the LORD to war,

04:032:021 And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD,
           until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,

04:032:022 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye
           shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before
           Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the
           LORD.

04:032:023 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the
           LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.

04:032:024 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your
           sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.

04:032:025 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto
           Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

04:032:026 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,
           shall be there in the cities of Gilead:

04:032:027 But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war,
           before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.

04:032:028 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and
           Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of
           the children of Israel:

04:032:029 And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the
           children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man
           armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be
           subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead
           for a possession:

04:032:030 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
           possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

04:032:031 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
           saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we
           do.

04:032:032 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of
           Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side
           Jordan may be our's.

04:032:033 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to
           the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh
           the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,
           and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the
           cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country
           round about.

04:032:034 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

04:032:035 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

04:032:036 And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for
           sheep.

04:032:037 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
           Kirjathaim,

04:032:038 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and
           Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they
           builded.

04:032:039 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,
           and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.

04:032:040 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he
           dwelt therein.

04:032:041 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns
           thereof, and called them Havothjair.

04:032:042 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and
           called it Nobah, after his own name.

04:033:001 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went
           forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the
           hand of Moses and Aaron.

04:033:002 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys
           by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys
           according to their goings out.

04:033:003 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the
           fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the
           passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in
           the sight of all the Egyptians.

04:033:004 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD
           had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed
           judgments.

04:033:005 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched
           in Succoth.

04:033:006 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is
           in the edge of the wilderness.

04:033:007 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,
           which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.

04:033:008 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through
           the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days'
           journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.

04:033:009 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim
           were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm
           trees; and they pitched there.

04:033:010 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.

04:033:011 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the
           wilderness of Sin.

04:033:012 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and
           encamped in Dophkah.

04:033:013 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

04:033:014 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where
           was no water for the people to drink.

04:033:015 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness
           of Sinai.

04:033:016 And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at
           Kibrothhattaavah.

04:033:017 And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at
           Hazeroth.

04:033:018 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.

04:033:019 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.

04:033:020 And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.

04:033:021 And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.

04:033:022 And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.

04:033:023 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.

04:033:024 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.

04:033:025 And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.

04:033:026 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.

04:033:027 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.

04:033:028 And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.

04:033:029 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.

04:033:030 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.

04:033:031 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.

04:033:032 And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.

04:033:033 And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.

04:033:034 And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.

04:033:035 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.

04:033:036 And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the
           wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.

04:033:037 And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the
           edge of the land of Edom.

04:033:038 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment
           of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the
           children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the
           first day of the fifth month.

04:033:039 And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when
           he died in mount Hor.

04:033:040 And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the
           land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

04:033:041 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.

04:033:042 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.

04:033:043 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.

04:033:044 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the
           border of Moab.

04:033:045 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.

04:033:046 And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in
           Almondiblathaim.

04:033:047 And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the
           mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

04:033:048 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in
           the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

04:033:049 And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto
           Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.

04:033:050 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
           near Jericho, saying,

04:033:051 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

04:033:052 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from
           before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all
           their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high
           places:

04:033:053 And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell
           therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

04:033:054 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among
           your families: and to the more ye shall give the more
           inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less
           inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place
           where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers
           ye shall inherit.

04:033:055 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from
           before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye
           let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in
           your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

04:033:056 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I
           thought to do unto them.

04:034:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:034:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall
           fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with
           the coasts thereof:)

04:034:003 Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin
           along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the
           outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:

04:034:004 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of
           Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof
           shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to
           Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:

04:034:005 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river
           of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

04:034:006 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great
           sea for a border: this shall be your west border.

04:034:007 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye
           shall point out for you mount Hor:

04:034:008 From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the
           entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall
           be to Zedad:

04:034:009 And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of
           it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.

04:034:010 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to
           Shepham:

04:034:011 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the
           east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall
           reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:

04:034:012 And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of
           it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the
           coasts thereof round about.

04:034:013 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is
           the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD
           commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:

04:034:014 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house
           of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad
           according to the house of their fathers, have received their
           inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received
           their inheritance:

04:034:015 The two tribes and the half tribe have received their
           inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward
           the sunrising.

04:034:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:034:017 These are the names of the men which shall divide the land
           unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

04:034:018 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the
           land by inheritance.

04:034:019 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah,
           Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

04:034:020 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of
           Ammihud.

04:034:021 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

04:034:022 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the
           son of Jogli.

04:034:023 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the
           children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

04:034:024 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel
           the son of Shiphtan.

04:034:025 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun,
           Elizaphan the son of Parnach.

04:034:026 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar,
           Paltiel the son of Azzan.

04:034:027 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud
           the son of Shelomi.

04:034:028 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali,
           Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

04:034:029 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the
           inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

04:035:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
           near Jericho, saying,

04:035:002 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the
           Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell
           in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the
           cities round about them.

04:035:003 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of
           them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for
           all their beasts.

04:035:004 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the
           Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a
           thousand cubits round about.

04:035:005 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side
           two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand
           cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the
           north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the
           midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.

04:035:006 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites
           there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint
           for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye
           shall add forty and two cities.

04:035:007 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be
           forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.

04:035:008 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession
           of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall
           give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few:
           every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according
           to his inheritance which he inheriteth.

04:035:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

04:035:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
           be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

04:035:011 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for
           you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any
           person at unawares.

04:035:012 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;
           that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the
           congregation in judgment.

04:035:013 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye
           have for refuge.

04:035:014 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three
           cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be
           cities of refuge.

04:035:015 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of
           Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among
           them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee
           thither.

04:035:016 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he
           die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to
           death.

04:035:017 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may
           die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely
           be put to death.

04:035:018 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he
           may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall
           surely be put to death.

04:035:019 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he
           meeteth him, he shall slay him.

04:035:020 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of
           wait, that he die;

04:035:021 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that
           smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer:
           the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth
           him.

04:035:022 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast
           upon him any thing without laying of wait,

04:035:023 Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not,
           and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy,
           neither sought his harm:

04:035:024 Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the
           revenger of blood according to these judgments:

04:035:025 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand
           of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore
           him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he
           shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was
           anointed with the holy oil.

04:035:026 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of
           the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;

04:035:027 And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the
           city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer;
           he shall not be guilty of blood:

04:035:028 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge
           until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the
           high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his
           possession.

04:035:029 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you
           throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

04:035:030 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death
           by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify
           against any person to cause him to die.

04:035:031 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a
           murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put
           to death.

04:035:032 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the
           city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the
           land, until the death of the priest.

04:035:033 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it
           defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the
           blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed
           it.

04:035:034 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein
           I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

04:036:001 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of
           Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
           families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before
           Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the
           children of Israel:

04:036:002 And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for
           an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord
           was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of
           Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.

04:036:003 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes
           of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be
           taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to
           the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so
           shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.

04:036:004 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then
           shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the
           tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance
           be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our
           fathers.

04:036:005 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the
           word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath
           said well.

04:036:006 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the
           daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they
           think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father
           shall they marry.

04:036:007 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove
           from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel
           shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his
           fathers.

04:036:008 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any
           tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the
           family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel
           may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.

04:036:009 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another
           tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel
           shall keep himself to his own inheritance.

04:036:010 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
           Zelophehad:

04:036:011 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the
           daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's
           brothers' sons:

04:036:012 And they were married into the families of the sons of
           Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in
           the tribe of the family of their father.

04:036:013 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD
           commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in
           the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

Book 05        Deuteronomy

05:001:001 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this
           side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the
           Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth,
           and Dizahab.

05:001:002 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount
           Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)

05:001:003 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh
           month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto
           the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had
           given him in commandment unto them;

05:001:004 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt
           in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth
           in Edrei:

05:001:005 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to
           declare this law, saying,

05:001:006 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt
           long enough in this mount:

05:001:007 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the
           Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the
           plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by
           the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon,
           unto the great river, the river Euphrates.

05:001:008 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the
           land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
           and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.

05:001:009 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to
           bear you myself alone:

05:001:010 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are
           this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.

05:001:011 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so
           many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)

05:001:012 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden,
           and your strife?

05:001:013 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
           tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

05:001:014 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken
           is good for us to do.

05:001:015 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and
           made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and
           captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and
           captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.

05:001:016 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the
           causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between
           every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.

05:001:017 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear
           the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the
           face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is
           too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

05:001:018 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye
           should do.

05:001:019 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that
           great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the
           mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us;
           and we came to Kadeshbarnea.

05:001:020 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
           Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

05:001:021 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up
           and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto
           thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.

05:001:022 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will
           send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and
           bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what
           cities we shall come.

05:001:023 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you,
           one of a tribe:

05:001:024 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto
           the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

05:001:025 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and
           brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said,
           It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.

05:001:026 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
           commandment of the LORD your God:

05:001:027 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD
           hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,
           to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

05:001:028 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our
           heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the
           cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have
           seen the sons of the Anakims there.

05:001:029 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

05:001:030 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for
           you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your
           eyes;

05:001:031 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD
           thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way
           that ye went, until ye came into this place.

05:001:032 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,

05:001:033 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to
           pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way
           ye should go, and in a cloud by day.

05:001:034 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
           sware, saying,

05:001:035 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil
           generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your
           fathers.

05:001:036 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him
           will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his
           children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.

05:001:037 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou
           also shalt not go in thither.

05:001:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he
           shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel
           to inherit it.

05:001:039 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and
           your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good
           and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give
           it, and they shall possess it.

05:001:040 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
           wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

05:001:041 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
           LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD
           our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his
           weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.

05:001:042 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither
           fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your
           enemies.

05:001:043 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled
           against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously
           up into the hill.

05:001:044 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out
           against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in
           Seir, even unto Hormah.

05:001:045 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would
           not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

05:001:046 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that
           ye abode there.

05:002:001 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
           the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we
           compassed mount Seir many days.

05:002:002 And the LORD spake unto me, saying,

05:002:003 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you
           northward.

05:002:004 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through
           the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell
           in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed
           unto yourselves therefore:

05:002:005 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land,
           no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount
           Seir unto Esau for a possession.

05:002:006 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye
           shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.

05:002:007 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
           hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness:
           these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou
           hast lacked nothing.

05:002:008 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
           which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath,
           and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the
           wilderness of Moab.

05:002:009 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
           contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their
           land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the
           children of Lot for a possession.

05:002:010 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and
           many, and tall, as the Anakims;

05:002:011 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the
           Moabites called them Emims.

05:002:012 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
           Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before
           them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of
           his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.

05:002:013 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we
           went over the brook Zered.

05:002:014 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we
           were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years;
           until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out
           from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.

05:002:015 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy
           them from among the host, until they were consumed.

05:002:016 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
           dead from among the people,

05:002:017 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,

05:002:018 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

05:002:019 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
           distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give
           thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession;
           because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a
           possession.

05:002:020 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt
           therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

05:002:021 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the
           LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and
           dwelt in their stead:

05:002:022 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when
           he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded
           them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:

05:002:023 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
           Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them,
           and dwelt in their stead.)

05:002:024 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
           behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king
           of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend
           with him in battle.

05:002:025 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
           thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who
           shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in
           anguish because of thee.

05:002:026 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
           Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

05:002:027 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way,
           I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

05:002:028 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
           water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on
           my feet;

05:002:029 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
           which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over
           Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.

05:002:030 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for
           the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart
           obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as
           appeareth this day.

05:002:031 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon
           and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest
           inherit his land.

05:002:032 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to
           fight at Jahaz.

05:002:033 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote
           him, and his sons, and all his people.

05:002:034 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
           the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we
           left none to remain:

05:002:035 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the
           spoil of the cities which we took.

05:002:036 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and
           from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there
           was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered
           all unto us:

05:002:037 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not,
           nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in
           the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

05:003:001 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king
           of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to
           battle at Edrei.

05:003:002 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver
           him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou
           shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
           Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

05:003:003 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king
           of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was
           left to him remaining.

05:003:004 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
           which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region
           of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

05:003:005 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
           beside unwalled towns a great many.

05:003:006 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
           Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of
           every city.

05:003:007 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a
           prey to ourselves.

05:003:008 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of
           the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the
           river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;

05:003:009 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call
           it Shenir;)

05:003:010 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
           unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

05:003:011 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
           behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in
           Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length
           thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of
           a man.

05:003:012 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer,
           which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the
           cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

05:003:013 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of
           Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of
           Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

05:003:014 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto
           the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his
           own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

05:003:015 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

05:003:016 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from
           Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the
           border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the
           children of Ammon;

05:003:017 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from
           Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea,
           under Ashdothpisgah eastward.

05:003:018 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God
           hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over
           armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that
           are meet for the war.

05:003:019 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I
           know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities
           which I have given you;

05:003:020 Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as
           unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD
           your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye
           return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.

05:003:021 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have
           seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two
           kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou
           passest.

05:003:022 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight
           for you.

05:003:023 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,

05:003:024 O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness,
           and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in
           earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to
           thy might?

05:003:025 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is
           beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

05:003:026 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not
           hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak
           no more unto me of this matter.

05:003:027 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
           westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and
           behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this
           Jordan.

05:003:028 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for
           he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them
           to inherit the land which thou shalt see.

05:003:029 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.

05:004:001 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto
           the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may
           live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of
           your fathers giveth you.

05:004:002 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither
           shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the
           commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

05:004:003 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for
           all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath
           destroyed them from among you.

05:004:004 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every
           one of you this day.

05:004:005 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the
           LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land
           whither ye go to possess it.

05:004:006 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
           understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear
           all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a
           wise and understanding people.

05:004:007 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto
           them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon
           him for?

05:004:008 And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and
           judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you
           this day?

05:004:009 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest
           thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest
           they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach
           them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;

05:004:010 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God
           in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people
           together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may
           learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the
           earth, and that they may teach their children.

05:004:011 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the
           mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with
           darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.

05:004:012 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye
           heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye
           heard a voice.

05:004:013 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you
           to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two
           tables of stone.

05:004:014 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes
           and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go
           over to possess it.

05:004:015 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no
           manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you
           in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:

05:004:016 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the
           similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

05:004:017 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness
           of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,

05:004:018 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the
           likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:

05:004:019 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou
           seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host
           of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve
           them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations
           under the whole heaven.

05:004:020 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the
           iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of
           inheritance, as ye are this day.

05:004:021 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and
           sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not
           go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
           for an inheritance:

05:004:022 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye
           shall go over, and possess that good land.

05:004:023 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the
           LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven
           image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God
           hath forbidden thee.

05:004:024 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

05:004:025 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and
           ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt
           yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any
           thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to
           provoke him to anger:

05:004:026 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that
           ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go
           over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon
           it, but shall utterly be destroyed.

05:004:027 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall
           be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD
           shall lead you.

05:004:028 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood
           and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

05:004:029 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou
           shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with
           all thy soul.

05:004:030 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come
           upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD
           thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;

05:004:031 (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake
           thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy
           fathers which he sware unto them.

05:004:032 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,
           since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask
           from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath
           been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard
           like it?

05:004:033 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the
           midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?

05:004:034 Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst
           of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders,
           and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm,
           and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God
           did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

05:004:035 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD
           he is God; there is none else beside him.

05:004:036 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
           instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire;
           and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.

05:004:037 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their
           seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his
           mighty power out of Egypt;

05:004:038 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier
           than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for
           an inheritance, as it is this day.

05:004:039 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that
           the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth
           beneath: there is none else.

05:004:040 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
           which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee,
           and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong
           thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee,
           for ever.

05:004:041 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
           sunrising;

05:004:042 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his
           neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that
           fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:

05:004:043 Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the
           Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in
           Bashan, of the Manassites.

05:004:044 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of
           Israel:

05:004:045 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
           judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
           after they came forth out of Egypt.

05:004:046 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in
           the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon,
           whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were
           come forth out of Egypt:

05:004:047 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of
           Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side
           Jordan toward the sunrising;

05:004:048 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto
           mount Sion, which is Hermon,

05:004:049 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the
           sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

05:005:001 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O
           Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears
           this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.

05:005:002 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

05:005:003 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
           even us, who are all of us here alive this day.

05:005:004 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
           midst of the fire,

05:005:005 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you
           the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the
           fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,

05:005:006 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
           Egypt, from the house of bondage.

05:005:007 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

05:005:008 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of
           any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
           beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:

05:005:009 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for
           I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
           the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
           generation of them that hate me,

05:005:010 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep
           my commandments.

05:005:011 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for
           the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
           vain.

05:005:012 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath
           commanded thee.

05:005:013 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

05:005:014 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
           thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
           daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine
           ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger
           that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy
           maidservant may rest as well as thou.

05:005:015 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
           and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a
           mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy
           God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.

05:005:016 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath
           commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it
           may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God
           giveth thee.

05:005:017 Thou shalt not kill.

05:005:018 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

05:005:019 Neither shalt thou steal.

05:005:020 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

05:005:021 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt
           thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his
           manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any
           thing that is thy neighbour's.

05:005:022 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount
           out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick
           darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he
           wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.

05:005:023 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst
           of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that
           ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and
           your elders;

05:005:024 And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory
           and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the
           midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk
           with man, and he liveth.

05:005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
           consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more,
           then we shall die.

05:005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of
           the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we
           have, and lived?

05:005:027 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say:
           and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak
           unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.

05:005:028 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto
           me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the
           words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they
           have well said all that they have spoken.

05:005:029 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear
           me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well
           with them, and with their children for ever!

05:005:030 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.

05:005:031 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto
           thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the
           judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them
           in the land which I give them to possess it.

05:005:032 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath
           commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to
           the left.

05:005:033 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath
           commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with
           you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye
           shall possess.

05:006:001 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the
           judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you,
           that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:

05:006:002 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his
           statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and
           thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that
           thy days may be prolonged.

05:006:003 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be
           well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD
           God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that
           floweth with milk and honey.

05:006:004 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

05:006:005 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and
           with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

05:006:006 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in
           thine heart:

05:006:007 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and
           shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
           thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
           thou risest up.

05:006:008 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
           shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.

05:006:009 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on
           thy gates.

05:006:010 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee
           into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to
           Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities,
           which thou buildedst not,

05:006:011 And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not,
           and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive
           trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten
           and be full;

05:006:012 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee
           forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

05:006:013 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt
           swear by his name.

05:006:014 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people
           which are round about you;

05:006:015 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the
           anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy
           thee from off the face of the earth.

05:006:016 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in
           Massah.

05:006:017 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your
           God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath
           commanded thee.

05:006:018 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of
           the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
           go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy
           fathers.

05:006:019 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD
           hath spoken.

05:006:020 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What
           mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments,
           which the LORD our God hath commanded you?

05:006:021 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in
           Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty
           hand:

05:006:022 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon
           Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our
           eyes:

05:006:023 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in,
           to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

05:006:024 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear
           the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve
           us alive, as it is at this day.

05:006:025 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all
           these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath
           commanded us.

05:007:001 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither
           thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations
           before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the
           Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the
           Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier
           than thou;

05:007:002 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou
           shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no
           covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:

05:007:003 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou
           shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take
           unto thy son.

05:007:004 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they
           may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled
           against you, and destroy thee suddenly.

05:007:005 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their
           altars, and break down their images, and cut down their
           groves, and burn their graven images with fire.

05:007:006 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD
           thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,
           above all people that are upon the face of the earth.

05:007:007 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you,
           because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were
           the fewest of all people:

05:007:008 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the
           oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD
           brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of
           the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

05:007:009 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful
           God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him
           and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;

05:007:010 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy
           them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will
           repay him to his face.

05:007:011 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes,
           and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.

05:007:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these
           judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall
           keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto
           thy fathers:

05:007:013 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he
           will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy
           land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of
           thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he
           sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

05:007:014 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be
           male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.

05:007:015 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will
           put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest,
           upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.

05:007:016 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God
           shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them:
           neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare
           unto thee.

05:007:017 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than
           I; how can I dispossess them?

05:007:018 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what
           the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

05:007:019 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and
           the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm,
           whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD
           thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.

05:007:020 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them,
           until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be
           destroyed.

05:007:021 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is
           among you, a mighty God and terrible.

05:007:022 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by
           little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest
           the beasts of the field increase upon thee.

05:007:023 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall
           destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be
           destroyed.

05:007:024 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou
           shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man
           be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

05:007:025 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou
           shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take
           it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an
           abomination to the LORD thy God.

05:007:026 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest
           thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest
           it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

05:008:001 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
           observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and
           possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.

05:008:002 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led
           thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and
           to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou
           wouldest keep his commandments, or no.

05:008:003 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee
           with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers
           know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by
           bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth
           of the LORD doth man live.

05:008:004 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot
           swell, these forty years.

05:008:005 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man
           chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.

05:008:006 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy
           God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.

05:008:007 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of
           brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of
           valleys and hills;

05:008:008 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
           pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

05:008:009 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou
           shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron,
           and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

05:008:010 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the
           LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.

05:008:011 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping
           his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I
           command thee this day:

05:008:012 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly
           houses, and dwelt therein;

05:008:013 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and
           thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;

05:008:014 Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy
           God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from
           the house of bondage;

05:008:015 Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness,
           wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where
           there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the
           rock of flint;

05:008:016 Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers
           knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove
           thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;

05:008:017 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine
           hand hath gotten me this wealth.

05:008:018 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that
           giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his
           covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

05:008:019 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God,
           and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I
           testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

05:008:020 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so
           shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the
           voice of the LORD your God.

05:009:001 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go
           in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself,
           cities great and fenced up to heaven,

05:009:002 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom
           thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand
           before the children of Anak!

05:009:003 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he
           which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall
           destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so
           shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the
           LORD hath said unto thee.

05:009:004 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God
           hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my
           righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this
           land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth
           drive them out from before thee.

05:009:005 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine
           heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the
           wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them
           out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which
           the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

05:009:006 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not
           this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou
           art a stiffnecked people.

05:009:007 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God
           to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst
           depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this
           place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.

05:009:008 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD
           was angry with you to have destroyed you.

05:009:009 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of
           stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made
           with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty
           nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:

05:009:010 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written
           with the finger of God; and on them was written according to
           all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out
           of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

05:009:011 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
           that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables
           of the covenant.

05:009:012 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
           hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of
           Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside
           out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a
           molten image.

05:009:013 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this
           people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

05:009:014 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name
           from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier
           and greater than they.

05:009:015 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned
           with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two
           hands.

05:009:016 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your
           God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside
           quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.

05:009:017 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
           and brake them before your eyes.

05:009:018 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days
           and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water,
           because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in
           the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

05:009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith
           the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD
           hearkened unto me at that time also.

05:009:020 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him:
           and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

05:009:021 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it
           with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even
           until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof
           into the brook that descended out of the mount.

05:009:022 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye
           provoked the LORD to wrath.

05:009:023 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go
           up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye
           rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye
           believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.

05:009:024 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I
           knew you.

05:009:025 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights,
           as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he
           would destroy you.

05:009:026 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD,
           destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast
           redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth
           out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

05:009:027 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not
           unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,
           nor to their sin:

05:009:028 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the
           LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he
           promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them
           out to slay them in the wilderness.

05:009:029 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou
           broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out
           arm.

05:010:001 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of
           stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount,
           and make thee an ark of wood.

05:010:002 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the
           first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in
           the ark.

05:010:003 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of
           stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having
           the two tables in mine hand.

05:010:004 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
           the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the
           mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly:
           and the LORD gave them unto me.

05:010:005 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
           tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the
           LORD commanded me.

05:010:006 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of
           the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there
           he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's
           office in his stead.

05:010:007 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
           Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

05:010:008 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the
           ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to
           minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

05:010:009 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;
           the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God
           promised him.

05:010:010 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty
           days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that
           time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.

05:010:011 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the
           people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I
           sware unto their fathers to give unto them.

05:010:012 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee,
           but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to
           love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and
           with all thy soul,

05:010:013 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which
           I command thee this day for thy good?

05:010:014 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy
           God, the earth also, with all that therein is.

05:010:015 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and
           he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as
           it is this day.

05:010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no
           more stiffnecked.

05:010:017 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a
           great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not
           persons, nor taketh reward:

05:010:018 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and
           loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

05:010:019 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the
           land of Egypt.

05:010:020 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to
           him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

05:010:021 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee
           these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

05:010:022 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
           persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars
           of heaven for multitude.

05:011:001 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his
           charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his
           commandments, alway.

05:011:002 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which
           have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of
           the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his
           stretched out arm,

05:011:003 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of
           Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

05:011:004 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and
           to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to
           overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath
           destroyed them unto this day;

05:011:005 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into
           this place;

05:011:006 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the
           son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed
           them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the
           substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all
           Israel:

05:011:007 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which
           he did.

05:011:008 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command
           you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the
           land, whither ye go to possess it;

05:011:009 And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD
           sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a
           land that floweth with milk and honey.

05:011:010 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as
           the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst
           thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of
           herbs:

05:011:011 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills
           and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

05:011:012 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD
           thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year
           even unto the end of the year.

05:011:013 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto
           my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD
           your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all
           your soul,

05:011:014 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,
           the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in
           thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

05:011:015 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou
           mayest eat and be full.

05:011:016 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and
           ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

05:011:017 And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut
           up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield
           not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good
           land which the LORD giveth you.

05:011:018 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in
           your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they
           may be as frontlets between your eyes.

05:011:019 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when
           thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way,
           when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

05:011:020 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,
           and upon thy gates:

05:011:021 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your
           children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers
           to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

05:011:022 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I
           command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in
           all his ways, and to cleave unto him;

05:011:023 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before
           you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than
           yourselves.

05:011:024 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall
           be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the
           river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast
           be.

05:011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD
           your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon
           all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto
           you.

05:011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

05:011:027 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God,
           which I command you this day:

05:011:028 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD
           your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you
           this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.

05:011:029 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought
           thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that
           thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse
           upon mount Ebal.

05:011:030 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the
           sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in
           the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

05:011:031 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land
           which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it,
           and dwell therein.

05:011:032 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments
           which I set before you this day.

05:012:001 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe
           to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth
           thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.

05:012:002 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations
           which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high
           mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:

05:012:003 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars,
           and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the
           graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out
           of that place.

05:012:004 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

05:012:005 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of
           all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his
           habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:

05:012:006 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your
           sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand,
           and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings
           of your herds and of your flocks:

05:012:007 And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall
           rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your
           households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.

05:012:008 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
           every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

05:012:009 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
           which the LORD your God giveth you.

05:012:010 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the
           LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you
           rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in
           safety;

05:012:011 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall
           choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye
           bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your
           sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand,
           and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:

05:012:012 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your
           sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your
           maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates;
           forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.

05:012:013 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings
           in every place that thou seest:

05:012:014 But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy
           tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there
           thou shalt do all that I command thee.

05:012:015 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy
           gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the
           blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the
           unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and
           as of the hart.

05:012:016 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the
           earth as water.

05:012:017 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or
           of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or
           of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy
           freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:

05:012:018 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place
           which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and
           thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
           Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before
           the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.

05:012:019 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long
           as thou livest upon the earth.

05:012:020 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath
           promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because
           thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh,
           whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

05:012:021 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his
           name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy
           herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I
           have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates
           whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

05:012:022 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat
           them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

05:012:023 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the
           life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

05:012:024 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
           water.

05:012:025 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with
           thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is
           right in the sight of the LORD.

05:012:026 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt
           take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:

05:012:027 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the
           blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of
           thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD
           thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.

05:012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it
           may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for
           ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the
           sight of the LORD thy God.

05:012:029 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before
           thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest
           them, and dwellest in their land;

05:012:030 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following
           them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that
           thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these
           nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.

05:012:031 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every
           abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto
           their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have
           burnt in the fire to their gods.

05:012:032 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt
           not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

05:013:001 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
           and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,

05:013:002 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto
           thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not
           known, and let us serve them;

05:013:003 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that
           dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know
           whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with
           all your soul.

05:013:004 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep
           his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him,
           and cleave unto him.

05:013:005 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to
           death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD
           your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and
           redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out
           of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in.
           So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.

05:013:006 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy
           daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as
           thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and
           serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy
           fathers;

05:013:007 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you,
           nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the
           earth even unto the other end of the earth;

05:013:008 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither
           shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither
           shalt thou conceal him:

05:013:009 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon
           him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the
           people.

05:013:010 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he
           hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which
           brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
           bondage.

05:013:011 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any
           such wickedness as this is among you.

05:013:012 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD
           thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,

05:013:013 Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among
           you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying,
           Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;

05:013:014 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently;
           and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such
           abomination is wrought among you;

05:013:015 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the
           edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is
           therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

05:013:016 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of
           the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all
           the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it
           shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.

05:013:017 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine
           hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger,
           and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and
           multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;

05:013:018 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to
           keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do
           that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.

05:014:001 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut
           yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the
           dead.

05:014:002 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the
           LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself,
           above all the nations that are upon the earth.

05:014:003 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.

05:014:004 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep,
           and the goat,

05:014:005 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild
           goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

05:014:006 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft
           into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye
           shall eat.

05:014:007 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud,
           or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the
           hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the
           hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.

05:014:008 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not
           the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their
           flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.

05:014:009 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that
           have fins and scales shall ye eat:

05:014:010 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is
           unclean unto you.

05:014:011 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.

05:014:012 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and
           the ossifrage, and the ospray,

05:014:013 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,

05:014:014 And every raven after his kind,

05:014:015 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
           after his kind,

05:014:016 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,

05:014:017 And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,

05:014:018 And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing,
           and the bat.

05:014:019 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they
           shall not be eaten.

05:014:020 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.

05:014:021 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt
           give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may
           eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an
           holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid
           in his mother's milk.

05:014:022 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the
           field bringeth forth year by year.

05:014:023 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which
           he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy
           corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy
           herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the
           LORD thy God always.

05:014:024 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able
           to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the
           LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD
           thy God hath blessed thee:

05:014:025 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in
           thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God
           shall choose:

05:014:026 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul
           lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for
           strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou
           shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt
           rejoice, thou, and thine household,

05:014:027 And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not
           forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.

05:014:028 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe
           of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within
           thy gates:

05:014:029 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with
           thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,
           which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be
           satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the
           work of thine hand which thou doest.

05:015:001 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.

05:015:002 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that
           lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall
           not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it
           is called the LORD's release.

05:015:003 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is
           thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;

05:015:004 Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall
           greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
           thee for an inheritance to possess it:

05:015:005 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy
           God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command
           thee this day.

05:015:006 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and
           thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow;
           and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not
           reign over thee.

05:015:007 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within
           any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth
           thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand
           from thy poor brother:

05:015:008 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely
           lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.

05:015:009 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,
           saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and
           thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest
           him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be
           sin unto thee.

05:015:010 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be
           grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing
           the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all
           that thou puttest thine hand unto.

05:015:011 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I
           command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy
           brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

05:015:012 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold
           unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year
           thou shalt let him go free from thee.

05:015:013 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not
           let him go away empty:

05:015:014 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of
           thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the
           LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.

05:015:015 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
           of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I
           command thee this thing to day.

05:015:016 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from
           thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is
           well with thee;

05:015:017 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear
           unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also
           unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

05:015:018 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away
           free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant
           to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall
           bless thee in all that thou doest.

05:015:019 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock
           thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no
           work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the
           firstling of thy sheep.

05:015:020 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the
           place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.

05:015:021 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or
           blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it
           unto the LORD thy God.

05:015:022 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean
           person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.

05:015:023 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it
           upon the ground as water.

05:016:001 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD
           thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought
           thee forth out of Egypt by night.

05:016:002 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy
           God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD
           shall choose to place his name there.

05:016:003 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt
           thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of
           affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in
           haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest
           forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.

05:016:004 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy
           coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh,
           which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all
           night until the morning.

05:016:005 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy
           gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:

05:016:006 But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place
           his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even,
           at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest
           forth out of Egypt.

05:016:007 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD
           thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and
           go unto thy tents.

05:016:008 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh
           day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt
           do no work therein.

05:016:009 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the
           seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle
           to the corn.

05:016:010 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God
           with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which
           thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD
           thy God hath blessed thee:

05:016:011 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy
           son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy
           maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the
           stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among
           you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place
           his name there.

05:016:012 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and
           thou shalt observe and do these statutes.

05:016:013 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after
           that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:

05:016:014 And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and
           thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
           Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that
           are within thy gates.

05:016:015 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy
           God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD
           thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the
           works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

05:016:016 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the
           LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast
           of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the
           feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the
           LORD empty:

05:016:017 Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing
           of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.

05:016:018 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates,
           which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and
           they shall judge the people with just judgment.

05:016:019 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,
           neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the
           wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.

05:016:020 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou
           mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God
           giveth thee.

05:016:021 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the
           altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.

05:016:022 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy
           God hateth.

05:017:001 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or
           sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that
           is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

05:017:002 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the
           LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought
           wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing
           his covenant,

05:017:003 And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them,
           either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I
           have not commanded;

05:017:004 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired
           diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain,
           that such abomination is wrought in Israel:

05:017:005 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have
           committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or
           that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

05:017:006 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he
           that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of
           one witness he shall not be put to death.

05:017:007 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him
           to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou
           shalt put the evil away from among you.

05:017:008 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between
           blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and
           stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then
           shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the
           LORD thy God shall choose;

05:017:009 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the
           judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall
           shew thee the sentence of judgment:

05:017:010 And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of
           that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and
           thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform
           thee:

05:017:011 According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach
           thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell
           thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence
           which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the
           left.

05:017:012 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken
           unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the
           LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and
           thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.

05:017:013 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more
           presumptuously.

05:017:014 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth
           thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt
           say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that
           are about me;

05:017:015 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD
           thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou
           set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee,
           which is not thy brother.

05:017:016 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the
           people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply
           horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall
           henceforth return no more that way.

05:017:017 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart
           turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself
           silver and gold.

05:017:018 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his
           kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book
           out of that which is before the priests the Levites:

05:017:019 And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the
           days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God,
           to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do
           them:

05:017:020 That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that
           he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or
           to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his
           kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

05:018:001 The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have
           no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the
           offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.

05:018:002 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren:
           the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

05:018:003 And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them
           that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they
           shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks,
           and the maw.

05:018:004 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine
           oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give
           him.

05:018:005 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to
           stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons
           for ever.

05:018:006 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,
           where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind
           unto the place which the LORD shall choose;

05:018:007 Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all
           his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the
           LORD.

05:018:008 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh
           of the sale of his patrimony.

05:018:009 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth
           thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of
           those nations.

05:018:010 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son
           or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth
           divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a
           witch.

05:018:011 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a
           wizard, or a necromancer.

05:018:012 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD:
           and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive
           them out from before thee.

05:018:013 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.

05:018:014 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto
           observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the
           LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.

05:018:015 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the
           midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye
           shall hearken;

05:018:016 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in
           Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear
           again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this
           great fire any more, that I die not.

05:018:017 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which
           they have spoken.

05:018:018 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like
           unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall
           speak unto them all that I shall command him.

05:018:019 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken
           unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require
           it of him.

05:018:020 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my
           name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall
           speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

05:018:021 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word
           which the LORD hath not spoken?

05:018:022 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing
           follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD
           hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it
           presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

05:019:001 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the
           LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and
           dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;

05:019:002 Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy
           land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.

05:019:003 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy
           land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into
           three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.

05:019:004 And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither,
           that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom
           he hated not in time past;

05:019:005 As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew
           wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down
           the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth
           upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of
           those cities, and live:

05:019:006 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his
           heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and
           slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he
           hated him not in time past.

05:019:007 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three
           cities for thee.

05:019:008 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn
           unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised
           to give unto thy fathers;

05:019:009 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I
           command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk
           ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for
           thee, beside these three:

05:019:010 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD
           thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon
           thee.

05:019:011 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him,
           and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die,
           and fleeth into one of these cities:

05:019:012 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence,
           and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he
           may die.

05:019:013 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the
           guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with
           thee.

05:019:014 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of
           old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt
           inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to
           possess it.

05:019:015 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity,
           or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of
           two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the
           matter be established.

05:019:016 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against
           him that which is wrong;

05:019:017 Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall
           stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges,
           which shall be in those days;

05:019:018 And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold,
           if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely
           against his brother;

05:019:019 Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto
           his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

05:019:020 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall
           henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

05:019:021 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye
           for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

05:020:001 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest
           horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not
           afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which
           brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

05:020:002 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that
           the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

05:020:003 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day
           unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint,
           fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because
           of them;

05:020:004 For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for
           you against your enemies, to save you.

05:020:005 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man
           is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated
           it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the
           battle, and another man dedicate it.

05:020:006 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not
           yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house,
           lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.

05:020:007 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not
           taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die
           in the battle, and another man take her.

05:020:008 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they
           shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted?
           let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's
           heart faint as well as his heart.

05:020:009 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of
           speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the
           armies to lead the people.

05:020:010 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then
           proclaim peace unto it.

05:020:011 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open
           unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found
           therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve
           thee.

05:020:012 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war
           against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:

05:020:013 And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands,
           thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the
           sword:

05:020:014 But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all
           that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou
           take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine
           enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

05:020:015 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off
           from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

05:020:016 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth
           give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing
           that breatheth:

05:020:017 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and
           the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites,
           and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:

05:020:018 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,
           which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against
           the LORD your God.

05:020:019 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war
           against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees
           thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of
           them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the
           field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:

05:020:020 Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for
           meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt
           build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee,
           until it be subdued.

05:021:001 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God
           giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not
           known who hath slain him:

05:021:002 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they
           shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that
           is slain:

05:021:003 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain
           man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which
           hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the
           yoke;

05:021:004 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a
           rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall
           strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:

05:021:005 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the
           LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in
           the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every
           controversy and every stroke be tried:

05:021:006 And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain
           man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded
           in the valley:

05:021:007 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this
           blood, neither have our eyes seen it.

05:021:008 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast
           redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of
           Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.

05:021:009 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among
           you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of
           the LORD.

05:021:010 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the
           LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou
           hast taken them captive,

05:021:011 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a
           desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

05:021:012 Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall
           shave her head, and pare her nails;

05:021:013 And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her,
           and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her
           mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her,
           and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.

05:021:014 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou
           shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her
           at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her,
           because thou hast humbled her.

05:021:015 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and
           they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated;
           and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:

05:021:016 Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that
           which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved
           firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the
           firstborn:

05:021:017 But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the
           firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath:
           for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the
           firstborn is his.

05:021:018 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not
           obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and
           that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto
           them:

05:021:019 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and
           bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate
           of his place;

05:021:020 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son
           is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is
           a glutton, and a drunkard.

05:021:021 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that
           he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all
           Israel shall hear, and fear.

05:021:022 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be
           to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:

05:021:023 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou
           shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is
           accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD
           thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

05:022:001 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray,
           and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them
           again unto thy brother.

05:022:002 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him
           not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it
           shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou
           shalt restore it to him again.

05:022:003 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou
           do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's,
           which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do
           likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.

05:022:004 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by
           the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help
           him to lift them up again.

05:022:005 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,
           neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do
           so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

05:022:006 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any
           tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs,
           and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou
           shalt not take the dam with the young:

05:022:007 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young
           to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
           prolong thy days.

05:022:008 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a
           battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine
           house, if any man fall from thence.

05:022:009 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the
           fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy
           vineyard, be defiled.

05:022:010 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

05:022:011 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen
           and linen together.

05:022:012 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy
           vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.

05:022:013 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

05:022:014 And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil
           name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to
           her, I found her not a maid:

05:022:015 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and
           bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the
           elders of the city in the gate:

05:022:016 And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my
           daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;

05:022:017 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her,
           saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the
           tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the
           cloth before the elders of the city.

05:022:018 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise
           him;

05:022:019 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and
           give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath
           brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall
           be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

05:022:020 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not
           found for the damsel:

05:022:021 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her
           father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with
           stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel,
           to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put
           evil away from among you.

05:022:022 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband,
           then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with
           the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from
           Israel.

05:022:023 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and
           a man find her in the city, and lie with her;

05:022:024 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city,
           and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel,
           because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because
           he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away
           evil from among you.

05:022:025 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man
           force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with
           her shall die.

05:022:026 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the
           damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth
           against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this
           matter:

05:022:027 For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried,
           and there was none to save her.

05:022:028 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not
           betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be
           found;

05:022:029 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's
           father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife;
           because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his
           days.

05:022:030 A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his
           father's skirt.

05:023:001 He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut
           off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

05:023:002 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD;
           even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the
           congregation of the LORD.

05:023:003 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation
           of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not
           enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:

05:023:004 Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way,
           when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired
           against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia,
           to curse thee.

05:023:005 Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam;
           but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto
           thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.

05:023:006 Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy
           days for ever.

05:023:007 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou
           shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in
           his land.

05:023:008 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the
           congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

05:023:009 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep
           thee from every wicked thing.

05:023:010 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of
           uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go
           abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

05:023:011 But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself
           with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the
           camp again.

05:023:012 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou
           shalt go forth abroad:

05:023:013 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be,
           when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith,
           and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:

05:023:014 For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to
           deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee;
           therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing
           in thee, and turn away from thee.

05:023:015 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is
           escaped from his master unto thee:

05:023:016 He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which
           he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best:
           thou shalt not oppress him.

05:023:017 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a
           sodomite of the sons of Israel.

05:023:018 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a
           dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even
           both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

05:023:019 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money,
           usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:

05:023:020 Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy
           brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God
           may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the
           land whither thou goest to possess it.

05:023:021 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt
           not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require
           it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.

05:023:022 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

05:023:023 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and
           perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast
           vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy
           mouth.

05:023:024 When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou
           mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou
           shalt not put any in thy vessel.

05:023:025 When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then
           thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not
           move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.

05:024:001 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to
           pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath
           found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill
           of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of
           his house.

05:024:002 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
           another man's wife.

05:024:003 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of
           divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of
           his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be
           his wife;

05:024:004 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her
           again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is
           abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land
           to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

05:024:005 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war,
           neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be
           free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he
           hath taken.

05:024:006 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge:
           for he taketh a man's life to pledge.

05:024:007 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children
           of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then
           that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among
           you.

05:024:008 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe
           diligently, and do according to all that the priests the
           Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall
           observe to do.

05:024:009 Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way,
           after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.

05:024:010 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go
           into his house to fetch his pledge.

05:024:011 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend
           shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.

05:024:012 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:

05:024:013 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the
           sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and
           bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the
           LORD thy God.

05:024:014 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and
           needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that
           are in thy land within thy gates:

05:024:015 At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun
           go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon
           it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto
           thee.

05:024:016 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
           neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
           every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

05:024:017 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of
           the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:

05:024:018 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and
           the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command
           thee to do this thing.

05:024:019 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast
           forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch
           it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for
           the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the
           work of thine hands.

05:024:020 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the
           boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the
           fatherless, and for the widow.

05:024:021 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not
           glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the
           fatherless, and for the widow.

05:024:022 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
           of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

05:025:001 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto
           judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall
           justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.

05:025:002 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten,
           that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten
           before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.

05:025:003 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he
           should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,
           then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.

05:025:004 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.

05:025:005 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no
           child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a
           stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take
           her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's
           brother unto her.

05:025:006 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall
           succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his
           name be not put out of Israel.

05:025:007 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let
           his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say,
           My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a
           name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's
           brother.

05:025:008 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto
           him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;

05:025:009 Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of
           the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in
           his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto
           that man that will not build up his brother's house.

05:025:010 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that
           hath his shoe loosed.

05:025:011 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the
           one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of
           him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh
           him by the secrets:

05:025:012 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity
           her.

05:025:013 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a
           small.

05:025:014 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great
           and a small.

05:025:015 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and
           just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened
           in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

05:025:016 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously,
           are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

05:025:017 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were
           come forth out of Egypt;

05:025:018 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee,
           even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint
           and weary; and he feared not God.

05:025:019 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee
           rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the
           LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it,
           that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under
           heaven; thou shalt not forget it.

05:026:001 And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the
           LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest
           it, and dwellest therein;

05:026:002 That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the
           earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy
           God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go
           unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place
           his name there.

05:026:003 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days,
           and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God,
           that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our
           fathers for to give us.

05:026:004 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and
           set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.

05:026:005 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian
           ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt,
           and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation,
           great, mighty, and populous:

05:026:006 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and
           laid upon us hard bondage:

05:026:007 And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD
           heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour,
           and our oppression:

05:026:008 And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand,
           and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and
           with signs, and with wonders:

05:026:009 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this
           land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

05:026:010 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land,
           which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it
           before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:

05:026:011 And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy
           God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the
           Levite, and the stranger that is among you.

05:026:012 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
           increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and
           hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless,
           and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be
           filled;

05:026:013 Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought
           away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have
           given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the
           fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy
           commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not
           transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

05:026:014 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken
           away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought
           thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the
           LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast
           commanded me.

05:026:015 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy
           people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou
           swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and
           honey.

05:026:016 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these
           statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them
           with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

05:026:017 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to
           walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his
           commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his
           voice:

05:026:018 And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar
           people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep
           all his commandments;

05:026:019 And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in
           praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an
           holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

05:027:001 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people,
           saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this
           day.

05:027:002 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto
           the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt
           set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister:

05:027:003 And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when
           thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land
           which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with
           milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised
           thee.

05:027:004 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye
           shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in
           mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.

05:027:005 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an
           altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon
           them.

05:027:006 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole
           stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the
           LORD thy God:

05:027:007 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and
           rejoice before the LORD thy God.

05:027:008 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law
           very plainly.

05:027:009 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,
           saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art
           become the people of the LORD thy God.

05:027:010 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and
           do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee
           this day.

05:027:011 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

05:027:012 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when
           ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and
           Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:

05:027:013 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad,
           and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

05:027:014 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of
           Israel with a loud voice,

05:027:015 Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an
           abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the
           craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the
           people shall answer and say, Amen.

05:027:016 Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother.
           And all the people shall say, Amen.

05:027:017 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all
           the people shall say, Amen.

05:027:018 Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way.
           And all the people shall say, Amen.

05:027:019 Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
           fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

05:027:020 Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he
           uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say,
           Amen.

05:027:021 Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the
           people shall say, Amen.

05:027:022 Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his
           father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people
           shall say, Amen.

05:027:023 Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the
           people shall say, Amen.

05:027:024 Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the
           people shall say, Amen.

05:027:025 Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person.
           And all the people shall say, Amen.

05:027:026 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to
           do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.

05:028:001 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently
           unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all
           his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD
           thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:

05:028:002 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee,
           if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.

05:028:003 Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be
           in the field.

05:028:004 Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
           ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine,
           and the flocks of thy sheep.

05:028:005 Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

05:028:006 Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt
           thou be when thou goest out.

05:028:007 The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee
           to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against
           thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.

05:028:008 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy
           storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and
           he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
           thee.

05:028:009 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as
           he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments
           of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.

05:028:010 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by
           the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

05:028:011 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit
           of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit
           of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy
           fathers to give thee.

05:028:012 The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to
           give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all
           the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations,
           and thou shalt not borrow.

05:028:013 And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and
           thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if
           that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God,
           which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:

05:028:014 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I
           command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to
           go after other gods to serve them.

05:028:015 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the
           voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his
           commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day;
           that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:

05:028:016 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in
           the field.

05:028:017 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

05:028:018 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
           land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

05:028:019 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt
           thou be when thou goest out.

05:028:020 The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke,
           in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou
           be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the
           wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.

05:028:021 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he
           have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to
           possess it.

05:028:022 The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a
           fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning,
           and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and
           they shall pursue thee until thou perish.

05:028:023 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the
           earth that is under thee shall be iron.

05:028:024 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from
           heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

05:028:025 The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies:
           thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways
           before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the
           earth.

05:028:026 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and
           unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.

05:028:027 The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the
           emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou
           canst not be healed.

05:028:028 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
           astonishment of heart:

05:028:029 And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in
           darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou
           shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall
           save thee.

05:028:030 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
           thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein:
           thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes
           thereof.

05:028:031 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not
           eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from
           before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep
           shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to
           rescue them.

05:028:032 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people,
           and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all
           the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.

05:028:033 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation
           which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only
           oppressed and crushed alway:

05:028:034 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which
           thou shalt see.

05:028:035 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with
           a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot
           unto the top of thy head.

05:028:036 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set
           over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers
           have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and
           stone.

05:028:037 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a
           byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.

05:028:038 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt
           gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.

05:028:039 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither
           drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall
           eat them.

05:028:040 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but
           thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive
           shall cast his fruit.

05:028:041 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy
           them; for they shall go into captivity.

05:028:042 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.

05:028:043 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very
           high; and thou shalt come down very low.

05:028:044 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he
           shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

05:028:045 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall
           pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed;
           because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy
           God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he
           commanded thee:

05:028:046 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and
           upon thy seed for ever.

05:028:047 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness,
           and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

05:028:048 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall
           send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
           and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron
           upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.

05:028:049 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the
           end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose
           tongue thou shalt not understand;

05:028:050 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the
           person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:

05:028:051 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy
           land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee
           either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or
           flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.

05:028:052 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and
           fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all
           thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates
           throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given
           thee.

05:028:053 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of
           thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath
           given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith
           thine enemies shall distress thee:

05:028:054 So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate,
           his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife
           of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he
           shall leave:

05:028:055 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
           children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him
           in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies
           shall distress thee in all thy gates.

05:028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not
           adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for
           delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the
           husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her
           daughter,

05:028:057 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her
           feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she
           shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege
           and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in
           thy gates.

05:028:058 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that
           are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious
           and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;

05:028:059 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues
           of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and
           sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

05:028:060 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,
           which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

05:028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in
           the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee,
           until thou be destroyed.

05:028:062 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the
           stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey
           the voice of the LORD thy God.

05:028:063 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you
           to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice
           over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye
           shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to
           possess it.

05:028:064 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one
           end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt
           serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have
           known, even wood and stone.

05:028:065 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall
           the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee
           there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of
           mind:

05:028:066 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt
           fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:

05:028:067 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at
           even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear
           of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of
           thine eyes which thou shalt see.

05:028:068 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
           the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more
           again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for
           bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

05:029:001 These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded
           Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,
           beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

05:029:002 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have
           seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of
           Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all
           his land;

05:029:003 The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs,
           and those great miracles:

05:029:004 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes
           to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

05:029:005 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes
           are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon
           thy foot.

05:029:006 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong
           drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.

05:029:007 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon,
           and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle,
           and we smote them:

05:029:008 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto
           the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of
           Manasseh.

05:029:009 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that
           ye may prosper in all that ye do.

05:029:010 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your
           captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with
           all the men of Israel,

05:029:011 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy
           camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:

05:029:012 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God,
           and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee
           this day:

05:029:013 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself,
           and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee,
           and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
           and to Jacob.

05:029:014 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;

05:029:015 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the
           LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this
           day:

05:029:016 (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how
           we came through the nations which ye passed by;

05:029:017 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and
           stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)

05:029:018 Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or
           tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our
           God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there
           should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;

05:029:019 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse,
           that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have
           peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add
           drunkenness to thirst:

05:029:020 The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD
           and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the
           curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and
           the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.

05:029:021 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the
           tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant
           that are written in this book of the law:

05:029:022 So that the generation to come of your children that shall
           rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far
           land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and
           the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;

05:029:023 And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and
           burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass
           groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah,
           Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and
           in his wrath:

05:029:024 Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus
           unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?

05:029:025 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of
           the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he
           brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:

05:029:026 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods
           whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:

05:029:027 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to
           bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:

05:029:028 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
           wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another
           land, as it is this day.

05:029:029 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those
           things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children
           for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

05:030:001 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon
           thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before
           thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations,
           whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,

05:030:002 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his
           voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and
           thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;

05:030:003 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have
           compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all
           the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

05:030:004 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of
           heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and
           from thence will he fetch thee:

05:030:005 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy
           fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do
           thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.

05:030:006 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the
           heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine
           heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

05:030:007 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
           enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

05:030:008 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do
           all his commandments which I command thee this day.

05:030:009 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
           thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy
           cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD
           will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy
           fathers:

05:030:010 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to
           keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in
           this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God
           with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

05:030:011 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not
           hidden from thee, neither is it far off.

05:030:012 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up
           for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it,
           and do it?

05:030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
           shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we
           may hear it, and do it?

05:030:014 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy
           heart, that thou mayest do it.

05:030:015 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
           and evil;

05:030:016 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to
           walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
           statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and
           multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land
           whither thou goest to possess it.

05:030:017 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but
           shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

05:030:018 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and
           that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither
           thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.

05:030:019 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
           have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing:
           therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

05:030:020 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest
           obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he
           is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest
           dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to
           Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

05:031:001 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

05:031:002 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old
           this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath
           said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

05:031:003 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will
           destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess
           them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD
           hath said.

05:031:004 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,
           kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he
           destroyed.

05:031:005 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may
           do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have
           commanded you.

05:031:006 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
           them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee;
           he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

05:031:007 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight
           of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must
           go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn
           unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to
           inherit it.

05:031:008 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be
           with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear
           not, neither be dismayed.

05:031:009 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests
           the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.

05:031:010 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven
           years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast
           of tabernacles,

05:031:011 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in
           the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law
           before all Israel in their hearing.

05:031:012 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and
           thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and
           that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe
           to do all the words of this law:

05:031:013 And that their children, which have not known any thing, may
           hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live
           in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

05:031:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that
           thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the
           tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge.
           And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the
           tabernacle of the congregation.

05:031:015 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a
           cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the
           tabernacle.

05:031:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with
           thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring
           after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go
           to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant
           which I have made with them.

05:031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I
           will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they
           shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall
           them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils
           come upon us, because our God is not among us?

05:031:018 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils
           which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto
           other gods.

05:031:019 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
           children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may
           be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

05:031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
           unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they
           shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then
           will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke
           me, and break my covenant.

05:031:021 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
           befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a
           witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of
           their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about,
           even now, before I have brought them into the land which I
           sware.

05:031:022 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it
           the children of Israel.

05:031:023 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be
           strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the
           children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and
           I will be with thee.

05:031:024 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the
           words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

05:031:025 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
           covenant of the LORD, saying,

05:031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark
           of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for
           a witness against thee.

05:031:027 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I
           am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious
           against the LORD; and how much more after my death?

05:031:028 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your
           officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call
           heaven and earth to record against them.

05:031:029 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
           yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded
           you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye
           will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger
           through the work of your hands.

05:031:030 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
           the words of this song, until they were ended.

05:032:001 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,
           the words of my mouth.

05:032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as
           the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the
           showers upon the grass:

05:032:003 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye
           greatness unto our God.

05:032:004 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are
           judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right
           is he.

05:032:005 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of
           his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

05:032:006 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is
           not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made
           thee, and established thee?

05:032:007 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many
           generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy
           elders, and they will tell thee.

05:032:008 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
           when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the
           people according to the number of the children of Israel.

05:032:009 For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
           inheritance.

05:032:010 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
           wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him
           as the apple of his eye.

05:032:011 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
           spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her
           wings:

05:032:012 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god
           with him.

05:032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he
           might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck
           honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

05:032:014 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams
           of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of
           wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

05:032:015 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou
           art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he
           forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of
           his salvation.

05:032:016 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
           abominations provoked they him to anger.

05:032:017 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they
           knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers
           feared not.

05:032:018 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
           forgotten God that formed thee.

05:032:019 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
           provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

05:032:020 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
           their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation,
           children in whom is no faith.

05:032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;
           they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will
           move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I
           will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

05:032:022 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
           lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase,
           and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

05:032:023 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
           them.

05:032:024 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning
           heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth
           of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

05:032:025 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the
           young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of
           gray hairs.

05:032:026 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
           remembrance of them to cease from among men:

05:032:027 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
           adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they
           should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all
           this.

05:032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
           understanding in them.

05:032:029 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
           would consider their latter end!

05:032:030 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to
           flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut
           them up?

05:032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
           being judges.

05:032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
           Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are
           bitter:

05:032:033 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
           asps.

05:032:034 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
           treasures?

05:032:035 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall
           slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand,
           and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

05:032:036 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for
           his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and
           there is none shut up, or left.

05:032:037 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom
           they trusted,

05:032:038 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine
           of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and
           be your protection.

05:032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
           kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there
           any that can deliver out of my hand.

05:032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

05:032:041 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
           judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will
           reward them that hate me.

05:032:042 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
           devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the
           captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

05:032:043 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the
           blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his
           adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his
           people.

05:032:044 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the
           ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

05:032:045 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all
           Israel:

05:032:046 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words
           which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command
           your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.

05:032:047 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life:
           and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land,
           whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

05:032:048 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

05:032:049 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which
           is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and
           behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of
           Israel for a possession:

05:032:050 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered
           unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and
           was gathered unto his people:

05:032:051 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel
           at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin;
           because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of
           Israel.

05:032:052 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
           thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

05:033:001 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God
           blessed the children of Israel before his death.

05:033:002 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir
           unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with
           ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law
           for them.

05:033:003 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and
           they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy
           words.

05:033:004 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the
           congregation of Jacob.

05:033:005 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and
           the tribes of Israel were gathered together.

05:033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

05:033:007 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD,
           the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his
           hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from
           his enemies.

05:033:008 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy
           holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou
           didst strive at the waters of Meribah;

05:033:009 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen
           him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own
           children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy
           covenant.

05:033:010 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they
           shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon
           thine altar.

05:033:011 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;
           smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of
           them that hate him, that they rise not again.

05:033:012 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell
           in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day
           long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.

05:033:013 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for
           the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep
           that coucheth beneath,

05:033:014 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for
           the precious things put forth by the moon,

05:033:015 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the
           precious things of the lasting hills,

05:033:016 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof,
           and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the
           blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the
           head of him that was separated from his brethren.

05:033:017 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
           are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the
           people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten
           thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

05:033:018 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;
           and, Issachar, in thy tents.

05:033:019 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall
           offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the
           abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

05:033:020 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he
           dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the
           head.

05:033:021 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in
           a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the
           heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and
           his judgments with Israel.

05:033:022 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from
           Bashan.

05:033:023 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,
           and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west
           and the south.

05:033:024 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let
           him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in
           oil.

05:033:025 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall
           thy strength be.

05:033:026 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon
           the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

05:033:027 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
           everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from
           before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.

05:033:028 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob
           shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall
           drop down dew.

05:033:029 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people
           saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the
           sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found
           liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.

05:034:001 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of
           Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And
           the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

05:034:002 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and
           all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

05:034:003 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the
           city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

05:034:004 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware
           unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give
           it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine
           eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.

05:034:005 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of
           Moab, according to the word of the LORD.

05:034:006 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over
           against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto
           this day.

05:034:007 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died:
           his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

05:034:008 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of
           Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for
           Moses were ended.

05:034:009 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
           for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of
           Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded
           Moses.

05:034:010 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
           whom the LORD knew face to face,

05:034:011 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to
           do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
           and to all his land,

05:034:012 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which
           Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.

Book 06        Joshua

06:001:001 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came
           to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun,
           Moses' minister, saying,

06:001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
           Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do
           give to them, even to the children of Israel.

06:001:003 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that
           have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

06:001:004 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great
           river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and
           unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be
           your coast.

06:001:005 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the
           days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee:
           I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

06:001:006 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt
           thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto
           their fathers to give them.

06:001:007 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest
           observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant
           commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the
           left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.

06:001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but
           thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest
           observe to do according to all that is written therein: for
           then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt
           have good success.

06:001:009 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be
           not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is
           with thee whithersoever thou goest.

06:001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

06:001:011 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare
           you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this
           Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God
           giveth you to possess it.

06:001:012 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the
           tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

06:001:013 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD
           commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest,
           and hath given you this land.

06:001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
           the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye
           shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of
           valour, and help them;

06:001:015 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given
           you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your
           God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your
           possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave
           you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

06:001:016 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us
           we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

06:001:017 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
           hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he
           was with Moses.

06:001:018 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and
           will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest
           him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good
           courage.

06:002:001 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
           secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they
           went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged
           there.

06:002:002 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there
           came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to
           search out the country.

06:002:003 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth
           the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine
           house: for they be come to search out all the country.

06:002:004 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus,
           There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:

06:002:005 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate,
           when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went
           I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake
           them.

06:002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid
           them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon
           the roof.

06:002:007 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the
           fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone
           out, they shut the gate.

06:002:008 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
           roof;

06:002:009 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you
           the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all
           the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.

06:002:010 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red
           sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto
           the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side
           Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.

06:002:011 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
           neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because
           of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and
           in earth beneath.

06:002:012 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I
           have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto
           my father's house, and give me a true token:

06:002:013 And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my
           brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver
           our lives from death.

06:002:014 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not
           this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given
           us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

06:002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
           house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

06:002:016 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
           pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until
           the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.

06:002:017 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine
           oath which thou hast made us swear.

06:002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line
           of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down
           by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy
           brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.

06:002:019 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of
           thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head,
           and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in
           the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon
           him.

06:002:020 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
           thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.

06:002:021 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she
           sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet
           line in the window.

06:002:022 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there
           three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers
           sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.

06:002:023 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
           passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him
           all things that befell them:

06:002:024 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into
           our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the
           country do faint because of us.

06:003:001 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
           Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of
           Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.

06:003:002 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
           through the host;

06:003:003 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of
           the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites
           bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
           it.

06:003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
           thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may
           know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this
           way heretofore.

06:003:005 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to
           morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.

06:003:006 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of
           the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took
           up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.

06:003:007 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to
           magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know
           that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.

06:003:008 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
           covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water
           of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.

06:003:009 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and
           hear the words of the LORD your God.

06:003:010 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is
           among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before
           you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the
           Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the
           Jebusites.

06:003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth
           passeth over before you into Jordan.

06:003:012 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
           out of every tribe a man.

06:003:013 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of
           the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the
           earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of
           Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from
           above; and they shall stand upon an heap.

06:003:014 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents,
           to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the
           covenant before the people;

06:003:015 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the
           feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim
           of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the
           time of harvest,)

06:003:016 That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up
           upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside
           Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,
           even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people
           passed over right against Jericho.

06:003:017 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the
           Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people
           were passed clean over Jordan.

06:004:001 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
           over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

06:004:002 Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a
           man,

06:004:003 And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst
           of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood
           firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you,
           and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this
           night.

06:004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
           children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

06:004:005 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the
           LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every
           man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the
           number of the tribes of the children of Israel:

06:004:006 That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
           their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these
           stones?

06:004:007 Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut
           off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed
           over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these
           stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for
           ever.

06:004:008 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and
           took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD
           spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of
           the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto
           the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

06:004:009 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
           place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the
           covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.

06:004:010 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of
           Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded
           Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses
           commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.

06:004:011 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
           over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests,
           in the presence of the people.

06:004:012 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half
           the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children
           of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:

06:004:013 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the
           LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

06:004:014 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all
           Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the
           days of his life.

06:004:015 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

06:004:016 Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that
           they come up out of Jordan.

06:004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out
           of Jordan.

06:004:018 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
           covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan,
           and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry
           land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and
           flowed over all his banks, as they did before.

06:004:019 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
           first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of
           Jericho.

06:004:020 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
           Joshua pitch in Gilgal.

06:004:021 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
           children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What
           mean these stones?

06:004:022 Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over
           this Jordan on dry land.

06:004:023 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from
           before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God
           did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we
           were gone over:

06:004:024 That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the
           LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God
           for ever.

06:005:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
           were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
           Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had
           dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of
           Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted,
           neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the
           children of Israel.

06:005:002 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp
           knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second
           time.

06:005:003 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children
           of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

06:005:004 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the
           people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the
           men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came
           out of Egypt.

06:005:005 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
           people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they
           came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.

06:005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the
           wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which
           came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the
           voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not
           shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers
           that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and
           honey.

06:005:007 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them
           Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they
           had not circumcised them by the way.

06:005:008 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
           people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they
           were whole.

06:005:009 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
           reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the
           place is called Gilgal unto this day.

06:005:010 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
           passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the
           plains of Jericho.

06:005:011 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow
           after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the
           selfsame day.

06:005:012 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
           old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna
           any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan
           that year.

06:005:013 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he
           lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man
           over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua
           went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our
           adversaries?

06:005:014 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I
           now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did
           worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his
           servant?

06:005:015 And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy
           shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is
           holy. And Joshua did so.

06:006:001 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
           Israel: none went out, and none came in.

06:006:002 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine
           hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of
           valour.

06:006:003 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
           about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

06:006:004 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
           rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city
           seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

06:006:005 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast
           with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the
           trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and
           the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people
           shall ascend up every man straight before him.

06:006:006 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto
           them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests
           bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.

06:006:007 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city,
           and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.

06:006:008 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people,
           that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
           horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets:
           and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.

06:006:009 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
           trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests
           going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

06:006:010 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not
           shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any
           word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout;
           then shall ye shout.

06:006:011 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it
           once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

06:006:012 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
           the ark of the LORD.

06:006:013 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before
           the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the
           trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward
           came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and
           blowing with the trumpets.

06:006:014 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
           into the camp: so they did six days.

06:006:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
           about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the
           same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the
           city seven times.

06:006:016 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
           with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the
           LORD hath given you the city.

06:006:017 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
           therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she
           and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the
           messengers that we sent.

06:006:018 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing,
           lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed
           thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

06:006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
           are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the
           treasury of the LORD.

06:006:020 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
           and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the
           trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the
           wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
           every man straight before him, and they took the city.

06:006:021 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
           and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the
           edge of the sword.

06:006:022 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
           country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the
           woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

06:006:023 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out
           Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and
           all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and
           left them without the camp of Israel.

06:006:024 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein:
           only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of
           iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.

06:006:025 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's
           household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel
           even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which
           Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

06:006:026 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the
           man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city
           Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn,
           and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.

06:006:027 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised
           throughout all the country.

06:007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the
           accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,
           the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed
           thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the
           children of Israel.

06:007:002 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside
           Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying,
           Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.

06:007:003 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all
           the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
           up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour
           thither; for they are but few.

06:007:004 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand
           men: and they fled before the men of Ai.

06:007:005 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for
           they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and
           smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the
           people melted, and became as water.

06:007:006 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his
           face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the
           elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

06:007:007 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
           brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
           of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been
           content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!

06:007:008 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs
           before their enemies!

06:007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall
           hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name
           from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?

06:007:010 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest
           thou thus upon thy face?

06:007:011 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my
           covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of
           the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also,
           and they have put it even among their own stuff.

06:007:012 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
           enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because
           they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more,
           except ye destroy the accursed from among you.

06:007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against
           to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an
           accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not
           stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed
           thing from among you.

06:007:014 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
           tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh
           shall come according to the families thereof; and the family
           which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the
           household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.

06:007:015 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing
           shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he
           hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he
           hath wrought folly in Israel.

06:007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by
           their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

06:007:017 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of
           the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by
           man; and Zabdi was taken:

06:007:018 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
           Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of
           Judah, was taken.

06:007:019 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory
           to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and
           tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.

06:007:020 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned
           against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

06:007:021 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and
           two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty
           shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and,
           behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and
           the silver under it.

06:007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
           behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

06:007:023 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought
           them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and
           laid them out before the LORD.

06:007:024 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of
           Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold,
           and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses,
           and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they
           brought them unto the valley of Achor.

06:007:025 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall
           trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones,
           and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with
           stones.

06:007:026 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day.
           So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore
           the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto
           this day.

06:008:001 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou
           dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go
           up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and
           his people, and his city, and his land:

06:008:002 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto
           Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle
           thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an
           ambush for the city behind it.

06:008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against
           Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour,
           and sent them away by night.

06:008:004 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
           against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from
           the city, but be ye all ready:

06:008:005 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto
           the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out
           against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,

06:008:006 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from
           the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the
           first: therefore we will flee before them.

06:008:007 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the
           city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

06:008:008 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall
           set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD
           shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.

06:008:009 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in
           ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of
           Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

06:008:010 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the
           people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the
           people to Ai.

06:008:011 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
           went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched
           on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them
           and Ai.

06:008:012 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
           ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

06:008:013 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was
           on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west
           of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the
           valley.

06:008:014 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they
           hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out
           against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time
           appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were
           liers in ambush against him behind the city.

06:008:015 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
           them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

06:008:016 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to
           pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were
           drawn away from the city.

06:008:017 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not
           out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued
           after Israel.

06:008:018 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is
           in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And
           Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward
           the city.

06:008:019 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran
           as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered
           into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on
           fire.

06:008:020 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and,
           behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they
           had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that
           fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

06:008:021 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken
           the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they
           turned again, and slew the men of Ai.

06:008:022 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they
           were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on
           that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them
           remain or escape.

06:008:023 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

06:008:024 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying
           all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness
           wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the
           edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the
           Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the
           sword.

06:008:025 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
           women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

06:008:026 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out
           the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants
           of Ai.

06:008:027 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a
           prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD
           which he commanded Joshua.

06:008:028 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
           desolation unto this day.

06:008:029 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
           soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should
           take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the
           entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great
           heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.

06:008:030 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in
           mount Ebal,

06:008:031 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of
           Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an
           altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any
           iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD,
           and sacrificed peace offerings.

06:008:032 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
           which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

06:008:033 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their
           judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the
           priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them;
           half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over
           against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had
           commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

06:008:034 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings
           and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of
           the law.

06:008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
           read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the
           women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were
           conversant among them.

06:009:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this
           side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the
           coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and
           the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
           Jebusite, heard thereof;

06:009:002 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
           and with Israel, with one accord.

06:009:003 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
           unto Jericho and to Ai,

06:009:004 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
           ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine
           bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;

06:009:005 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments
           upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and
           mouldy.

06:009:006 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
           him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country:
           now therefore make ye a league with us.

06:009:007 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye
           dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?

06:009:008 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua
           said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?

06:009:009 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants
           are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have
           heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,

06:009:010 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that
           were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king
           of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.

06:009:011 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country
           spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey,
           and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants:
           therefore now make ye a league with us.

06:009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
           on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it
           is dry, and it is mouldy:

06:009:013 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and,
           behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are
           become old by reason of the very long journey.

06:009:014 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at
           the mouth of the LORD.

06:009:015 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them,
           to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware
           unto them.

06:009:016 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had
           made a league with them, that they heard that they were their
           neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.

06:009:017 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their
           cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and
           Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

06:009:018 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes
           of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of
           Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.

06:009:019 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have
           sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we
           may not touch them.

06:009:020 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest
           wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto
           them.

06:009:021 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
           hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation;
           as the princes had promised them.

06:009:022 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
           Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from
           you; when ye dwell among us?

06:009:023 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be
           freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of
           water for the house of my God.

06:009:024 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
           told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his
           servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the
           inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were
           sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this
           thing.

06:009:025 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and
           right unto thee to do unto us, do.

06:009:026 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
           the children of Israel, that they slew them not.

06:009:027 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of
           water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD,
           even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

06:010:001 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had
           heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it;
           as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai
           and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace
           with Israel, and were among them;

06:010:002 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as
           one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
           and all the men thereof were mighty.

06:010:003 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king
           of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia
           king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

06:010:004 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it
           hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

06:010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of
           Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king
           of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together,
           and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before
           Gibeon, and made war against it.

06:010:006 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
           saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us
           quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the
           Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together
           against us.

06:010:007 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
           with him, and all the mighty men of valour.

06:010:008 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
           delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them
           stand before thee.

06:010:009 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from
           Gilgal all night.

06:010:010 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them
           with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the
           way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and
           unto Makkedah.

06:010:011 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
           in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great
           stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they
           were more which died with hailstones than they whom the
           children of Israel slew with the sword.

06:010:012 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD
           delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and
           he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon
           Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.

06:010:013 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
           had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written
           in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of
           heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

06:010:014 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
           LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought
           for Israel.

06:010:015 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
           Gilgal.

06:010:016 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
           Makkedah.

06:010:017 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid
           in a cave at Makkedah.

06:010:018 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
           and set men by it for to keep them:

06:010:019 And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the
           hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities:
           for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.

06:010:020 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel
           had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter,
           till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them
           entered into fenced cities.

06:010:021 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
           in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of
           Israel.

06:010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
           those five kings unto me out of the cave.

06:010:023 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him
           out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
           the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of
           Eglon.

06:010:024 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
           Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
           unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come
           near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they
           came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

06:010:025 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be
           strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all
           your enemies against whom ye fight.

06:010:026 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged
           them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until
           the evening.

06:010:027 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
           that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,
           and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and
           laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this
           very day.

06:010:028 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge
           of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them,
           and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and
           he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of
           Jericho.

06:010:029 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him,
           unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

06:010:030 And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the
           hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword,
           and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it;
           but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of
           Jericho.

06:010:031 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
           Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:

06:010:032 And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which
           took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the
           sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all
           that he had done to Libnah.

06:010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
           smote him and his people, until he had left him none
           remaining.

06:010:034 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
           him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:

06:010:035 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of
           the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly
           destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to
           Lachish.

06:010:036 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
           Hebron; and they fought against it:

06:010:037 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
           the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the
           souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to
           all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and
           all the souls that were therein.

06:010:038 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
           fought against it:

06:010:039 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities
           thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and
           utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left
           none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir,
           and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to
           her king.

06:010:040 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the
           south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their
           kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that
           breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.

06:010:041 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and
           all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

06:010:042 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one
           time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

06:010:043 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
           Gilgal.

06:011:001 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
           things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king
           of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

06:011:002 And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and
           of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in
           the borders of Dor on the west,

06:011:003 And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the
           Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite
           in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land
           of Mizpeh.

06:011:004 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
           people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in
           multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

06:011:005 And when all these kings were met together, they came and
           pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against
           Israel.

06:011:006 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them:
           for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain
           before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their
           chariots with fire.

06:011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against
           them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

06:011:008 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
           them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto
           Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and
           they smote them, until they left them none remaining.

06:011:009 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed
           their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

06:011:010 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
           the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the
           head of all those kingdoms.

06:011:011 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge
           of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left
           to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

06:011:012 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
           did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword,
           and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the
           LORD commanded.

06:011:013 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength,
           Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua
           burn.

06:011:014 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the
           children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every
           man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had
           destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.

06:011:015 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
           Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that
           the LORD commanded Moses.

06:011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
           country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the
           plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

06:011:017 Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto
           Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all
           their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.

06:011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

06:011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children of
           Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other
           they took in battle.

06:011:020 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they
           should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy
           them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he
           might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.

06:011:021 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
           mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all
           the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel:
           Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.

06:011:022 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
           of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there
           remained.

06:011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
           said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto
           Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the
           land rested from war.

06:012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of
           Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side
           Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto
           mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:

06:012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled
           from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and
           from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto
           the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of
           Ammon;

06:012:003 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and
           unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the
           way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:

06:012:004 And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant
           of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

06:012:005 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan,
           unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and
           half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

06:012:006 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of
           Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a
           possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
           tribe of Manasseh.

06:012:007 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the
           children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from
           Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak,
           that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of
           Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

06:012:008 In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and
           in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south
           country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the
           Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

06:012:009 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside
           Bethel, one;

06:012:010 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

06:012:011 The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

06:012:012 The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

06:012:013 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

06:012:014 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

06:012:015 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

06:012:016 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

06:012:017 The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

06:012:018 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

06:012:019 The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

06:012:020 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

06:012:021 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

06:012:022 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;

06:012:023 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the
           nations of Gilgal, one;

06:012:024 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.

06:013:001 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said
           unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there
           remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.

06:013:002 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
           Philistines, and all Geshuri,

06:013:003 From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of
           Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords
           of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the
           Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the
           Avites:

06:013:004 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
           that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the
           Amorites:

06:013:005 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the
           sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering
           into Hamath.

06:013:006 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
           Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out
           from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot
           unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded
           thee.

06:013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the
           nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

06:013:008 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
           inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward,
           even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;

06:013:009 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the
           city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of
           Medeba unto Dibon;

06:013:010 And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which
           reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

06:013:011 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites,
           and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;

06:013:012 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth
           and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for
           these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

06:013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the
           Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the
           Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.

06:013:014 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
           sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their
           inheritance, as he said unto them.

06:013:015 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
           inheritance according to their families.

06:013:016 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the
           river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river,
           and all the plain by Medeba;

06:013:017 Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and
           Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,

06:013:018 And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

06:013:019 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of
           the valley,

06:013:020 And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,

06:013:021 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
           king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses
           smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and
           Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the
           country.

06:013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
           of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by
           them.

06:013:023 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
           border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of
           Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages
           thereof.

06:013:024 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto
           the children of Gad according to their families.

06:013:025 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
           half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is
           before Rabbah;

06:013:026 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from
           Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

06:013:027 And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and
           Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
           Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of
           Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.

06:013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
           families, the cities, and their villages.

06:013:029 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh:
           and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children
           of Manasseh by their families.

06:013:030 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
           of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in
           Bashan, threescore cities:

06:013:031 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the
           kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of
           Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the
           children of Machir by their families.

06:013:032 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for
           inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan,
           by Jericho, eastward.

06:013:033 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the
           LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto
           them.

06:014:001 And these are the countries which the children of Israel
           inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and
           Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
           tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance
           to them.

06:014:002 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the
           hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

06:014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
           tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave
           none inheritance among them.

06:014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and
           Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the
           land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their
           cattle and for their substance.

06:014:005 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did,
           and they divided the land.

06:014:006 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and
           Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou
           knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God
           concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.

06:014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent
           me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him
           word again as it was in mine heart.

06:014:008 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart
           of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

06:014:009 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
           thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy
           children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the
           LORD my God.

06:014:010 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said,
           these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this
           word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the
           wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five
           years old.

06:014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
           sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now,
           for war, both to go out, and to come in.

06:014:012 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in
           that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were
           there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the
           LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out,
           as the LORD said.

06:014:013 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of
           Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.

06:014:014 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
           Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly
           followed the LORD God of Israel.

06:014:015 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was
           a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

06:015:001 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
           their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of
           Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.

06:015:002 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea,
           from the bay that looketh southward:

06:015:003 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and
           passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto
           Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar,
           and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

06:015:004 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the
           river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the
           sea: this shall be your south coast.

06:015:005 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
           Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay
           of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:

06:015:006 And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the
           north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of
           Bohan the son of Reuben:

06:015:007 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor,
           and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the
           going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river:
           and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the
           goings out thereof were at Enrogel:

06:015:008 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto
           the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the
           border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before
           the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the
           valley of the giants northward:

06:015:009 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
           fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities
           of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is
           Kirjathjearim:

06:015:010 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
           and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is
           Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and
           passed on to Timnah:

06:015:011 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and
           the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount
           Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the
           border were at the sea.

06:015:012 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast
           thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round
           about according to their families.

06:015:013 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
           children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to
           Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city
           is Hebron.

06:015:014 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
           Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

06:015:015 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the
           name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.

06:015:016 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
           to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

06:015:017 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
           and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

06:015:018 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him
           to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and
           Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?

06:015:019 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a
           south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the
           upper springs, and the nether springs.

06:015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
           according to their families.

06:015:021 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
           toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and
           Jagur,

06:015:022 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

06:015:023 And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

06:015:024 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

06:015:025 And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

06:015:026 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

06:015:027 And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,

06:015:028 And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,

06:015:029 Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,

06:015:030 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

06:015:031 And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,

06:015:032 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities
           are twenty and nine, with their villages:

06:015:033 And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

06:015:034 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

06:015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

06:015:036 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;
           fourteen cities with their villages:

06:015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,

06:015:038 And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,

06:015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

06:015:040 And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,

06:015:041 And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen
           cities with their villages:

06:015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

06:015:043 And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

06:015:044 And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their
           villages:

06:015:045 Ekron, with her towns and her villages:

06:015:046 From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with
           their villages:

06:015:047 Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns
           and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea,
           and the border thereof:

06:015:048 And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

06:015:049 And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,

06:015:050 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

06:015:051 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their
           villages:

06:015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

06:015:053 And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,

06:015:054 And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine
           cities with their villages:

06:015:055 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,

06:015:056 And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

06:015:057 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:

06:015:058 Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,

06:015:059 And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their
           villages:

06:015:060 Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities
           with their villages:

06:015:061 In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,

06:015:062 And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with
           their villages.

06:015:063 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
           children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites
           dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

06:016:001 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
           Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the
           wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,

06:016:002 And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the
           borders of Archi to Ataroth,

06:016:003 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the
           coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings
           out thereof are at the sea.

06:016:004 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
           inheritance.

06:016:005 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
           families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the
           east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;

06:016:006 And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the
           north side; and the border went about eastward unto
           Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;

06:016:007 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and
           came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

06:016:008 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river
           Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the
           inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their
           families.

06:016:009 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
           the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities
           with their villages.

06:016:010 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but
           the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and
           serve under tribute.

06:017:001 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
           firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of
           Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war,
           therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

06:017:002 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh
           by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the
           children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the
           children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for
           the children of Shemida: these were the male children of
           Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

06:017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son
           of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters:
           and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah,
           Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

06:017:004 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before
           Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The
           LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our
           brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD
           he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their
           father.

06:017:005 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
           Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;

06:017:006 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his
           sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

06:017:007 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
           lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right
           hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.

06:017:008 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the
           border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;

06:017:009 And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the
           river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of
           Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of
           the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:

06:017:010 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,
           and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on
           the north, and in Issachar on the east.

06:017:011 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
           towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor
           and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and
           the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants
           of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.

06:017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the
           inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in
           that land.

06:017:013 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
           strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not
           utterly drive them out.

06:017:014 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
           thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I
           am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me
           hitherto?

06:017:015 And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get
           thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in
           the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim
           be too narrow for thee.

06:017:016 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for
           us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the
           valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean
           and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.

06:017:017 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
           to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great
           power: thou shalt not have one lot only:

06:017:018 But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou
           shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for
           thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron
           chariots, and though they be strong.

06:018:001 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
           together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the
           congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.

06:018:002 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
           which had not yet received their inheritance.

06:018:003 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
           slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your
           fathers hath given you?

06:018:004 Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will
           send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and
           describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they
           shall come again to me.

06:018:005 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide
           in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall
           abide in their coasts on the north.

06:018:006 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and
           bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for
           you here before the LORD our God.

06:018:007 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of
           the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half
           the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond
           Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave
           them.

06:018:008 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
           went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the
           land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here
           cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.

06:018:009 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it
           by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua
           to the host at Shiloh.

06:018:010 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and
           there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel
           according to their divisions.

06:018:011 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
           according to their families: and the coast of their lot came
           forth between the children of Judah and the children of
           Joseph.

06:018:012 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
           border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and
           went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out
           thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.

06:018:013 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side
           of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended
           to Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of
           the nether Bethhoron.

06:018:014 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of
           the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron
           southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal,
           which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this
           was the west quarter.

06:018:015 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and
           the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of
           waters of Nephtoah:

06:018:016 And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth
           before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the
           valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley
           of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended
           to Enrogel,

06:018:017 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and
           went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up
           of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of
           Reuben,

06:018:018 And passed along toward the side over against Arabah
           northward, and went down unto Arabah:

06:018:019 And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah
           northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north
           bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the
           south coast.

06:018:020 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
           inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof
           round about, according to their families.

06:018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
           according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and
           the valley of Keziz,

06:018:022 And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

06:018:023 And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,

06:018:024 And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with
           their villages:

06:018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

06:018:026 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

06:018:027 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

06:018:028 And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and
           Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the
           inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their
           families.

06:019:001 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of
           the children of Simeon according to their families: and their
           inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of
           Judah.

06:019:002 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and
           Moladah,

06:019:003 And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

06:019:004 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

06:019:005 And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

06:019:006 And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their
           villages:

06:019:007 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their
           villages:

06:019:008 And all the villages that were round about these cities to
           Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of
           the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
           families.

06:019:009 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the
           inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the
           children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the
           children of Simeon had their inheritance within the
           inheritance of them.

06:019:010 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun
           according to their families: and the border of their
           inheritance was unto Sarid:

06:019:011 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
           reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before
           Jokneam;

06:019:012 And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the
           border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and
           goeth up to Japhia,

06:019:013 And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher,
           to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;

06:019:014 And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon:
           and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:

06:019:015 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and
           Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

06:019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
           to their families, these cities with their villages.

06:019:017 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
           Issachar according to their families.

06:019:018 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and
           Shunem,

06:019:019 And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath,

06:019:020 And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

06:019:021 And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

06:019:022 And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and
           Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan:
           sixteen cities with their villages.

06:019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
           Issachar according to their families, the cities and their
           villages.

06:019:024 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of
           Asher according to their families.

06:019:025 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and
           Achshaph,

06:019:026 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
           westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

06:019:027 And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to
           Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side
           of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left
           hand,

06:019:028 And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great
           Zidon;

06:019:029 And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city
           Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings
           thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:

06:019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with
           their villages.

06:019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
           according to their families, these cities with their villages.

06:019:032 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for
           the children of Naphtali according to their families.

06:019:033 And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and
           Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings
           thereof were at Jordan:

06:019:034 And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth
           out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the
           south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to
           Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.

06:019:035 And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath,
           and Chinnereth,

06:019:036 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

06:019:037 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,

06:019:038 And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh;
           nineteen cities with their villages.

06:019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
           Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their
           villages.

06:019:040 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of
           Dan according to their families.

06:019:041 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
           Irshemesh,

06:019:042 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

06:019:043 And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

06:019:044 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

06:019:045 And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,

06:019:046 And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

06:019:047 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for
           them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against
           Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
           and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
           after the name of Dan their father.

06:019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
           according to their families, these cities with their villages.

06:019:049 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
           by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to
           Joshua the son of Nun among them:

06:019:050 According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which
           he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the
           city, and dwelt therein.

06:019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and
           Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
           tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance
           by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the
           tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of
           dividing the country.

06:020:001 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,

06:020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you
           cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of
           Moses:

06:020:003 That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and
           unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge
           from the avenger of blood.

06:020:004 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall
           stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall
           declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they
           shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place,
           that he may dwell among them.

06:020:005 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall
           not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his
           neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

06:020:006 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
           congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high
           priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer
           return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house,
           unto the city from whence he fled.

06:020:007 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and
           Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in
           the mountain of Judah.

06:020:008 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they
           assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the
           tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad,
           and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

06:020:009 These were the cities appointed for all the children of
           Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that
           whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither,
           and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he
           stood before the congregation.

06:021:001 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
           Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto
           the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of
           Israel;

06:021:002 And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
           saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us
           cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.

06:021:003 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
           inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and
           their suburbs.

06:021:004 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and
           the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites,
           had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
           Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

06:021:005 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the
           families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,
           and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

06:021:006 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of
           the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out
           of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of
           Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.

06:021:007 The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe
           of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe
           of Zebulun, twelve cities.

06:021:008 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these
           cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand
           of Moses.

06:021:009 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and
           out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which
           are here mentioned by name.

06:021:010 Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
           Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs
           was the first lot.

06:021:011 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
           city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs
           thereof round about it.

06:021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave
           they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

06:021:013 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with
           her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah
           with her suburbs,

06:021:014 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,

06:021:015 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,

06:021:016 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
           Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two
           tribes.

06:021:017 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs,
           Geba with her suburbs,

06:021:018 Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were
           thirteen cities with their suburbs.

06:021:020 And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
           remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities
           of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

06:021:021 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim,
           to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her
           suburbs,

06:021:022 And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs;
           four cities.

06:021:023 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs,
           Gibbethon with her suburbs,

06:021:024 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:025 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her
           suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

06:021:026 All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of
           the children of Kohath that remained.

06:021:027 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the
           Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave
           Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for
           the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.

06:021:028 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,
           Dabareh with her suburbs,

06:021:029 Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:030 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon
           with her suburbs,

06:021:031 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:032 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
           suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor
           with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.

06:021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
           were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

06:021:034 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of
           the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her
           suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,

06:021:035 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:036 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and
           Jahazah with her suburbs,

06:021:037 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four
           cities.

06:021:038 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her
           suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim
           with her suburbs,

06:021:039 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities
           in all.

06:021:040 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their
           families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites,
           were by their lot twelve cities.

06:021:041 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the
           children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their
           suburbs.

06:021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about
           them: thus were all these cities.

06:021:043 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
           give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt
           therein.

06:021:044 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that
           he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all
           their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their
           enemies into their hand.

06:021:045 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had
           spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

06:022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
           half tribe of Manasseh,

06:022:002 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of
           the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I
           commanded you:

06:022:003 Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day,
           but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your
           God.

06:022:004 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren,
           as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto
           your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses
           the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.

06:022:005 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law,
           which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the
           LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
           commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with
           all your heart and with all your soul.

06:022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto
           their tents.

06:022:007 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
           possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave
           Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And
           when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he
           blessed them,

06:022:008 And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto
           your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with
           gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much
           raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.

06:022:009 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
           half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the
           children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of
           Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their
           possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word
           of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

06:022:010 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the
           land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
           and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan,
           a great altar to see to.

06:022:011 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of
           Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh
           have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the
           borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.

06:022:012 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole
           congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves
           together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.

06:022:013 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben,
           and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh,
           into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
           priest,

06:022:014 And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince
           throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head
           of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.

06:022:015 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
           of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of
           Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,

06:022:016 Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass
           is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to
           turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have
           builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the
           LORD?

06:022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are
           not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in
           the congregation of the LORD,

06:022:018 But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD?
           and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that
           to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of
           Israel.

06:022:019 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean,
           then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD,
           wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession
           among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against
           us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our
           God.

06:022:020 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the
           accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of
           Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.

06:022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
           half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of
           the thousands of Israel,

06:022:022 The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and
           Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in
           transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)

06:022:023 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the
           LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering,
           or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself
           require it;

06:022:024 And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing,
           saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our
           children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of
           Israel?

06:022:025 For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye
           children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the
           LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from
           fearing the LORD.

06:022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
           not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

06:022:027 But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our
           generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD
           before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,
           and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say
           to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.

06:022:028 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say
           to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say
           again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our
           fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but
           it is a witness between us and you.

06:022:029 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn
           this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt
           offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the
           altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.

06:022:030 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the
           congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were
           with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the
           children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased
           them.

06:022:031 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
           children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the
           children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is
           among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against
           the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of
           the hand of the LORD.

06:022:032 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
           returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of
           Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to
           the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

06:022:033 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children
           of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against
           them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of
           Reuben and Gad dwelt.

06:022:034 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
           altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD
           is God.

06:023:001 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
           rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that
           Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.

06:023:002 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and
           for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,
           and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:

06:023:003 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all
           these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that
           hath fought for you.

06:023:004 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that
           remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan,
           with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great
           sea westward.

06:023:005 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you,
           and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess
           their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.

06:023:006 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
           written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not
           aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;

06:023:007 That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among
           you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause
           to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto
           them:

06:023:008 But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this
           day.

06:023:009 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
           strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before
           you unto this day.

06:023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God,
           he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

06:023:011 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the
           LORD your God.

06:023:012 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
           of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall
           make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to
           you:

06:023:013 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive
           out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be
           snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and
           thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land
           which the LORD your God hath given you.

06:023:014 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and
           ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one
           thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your
           God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and
           not one thing hath failed thereof.

06:023:015 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
           come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall
           the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have
           destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God
           hath given you.

06:023:016 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
           which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods,
           and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD
           be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off
           the good land which he hath given unto you.

06:024:001 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
           called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for
           their judges, and for their officers; and they presented
           themselves before God.

06:024:002 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God
           of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood
           in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father
           of Nachor: and they served other gods.

06:024:003 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the
           flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and
           multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.

06:024:004 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau
           mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went
           down into Egypt.

06:024:005 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
           that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

06:024:006 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
           sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with
           chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.

06:024:007 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
           and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered
           them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and
           ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.

06:024:008 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt
           on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave
           them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I
           destroyed them from before you.

06:024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
           against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to
           curse you:

06:024:010 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you
           still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

06:024:011 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men
           of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the
           Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
           Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered
           them into your hand.

06:024:012 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
           before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with
           thy sword, nor with thy bow.

06:024:013 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
           cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the
           vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

06:024:014 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
           truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the
           other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.

06:024:015 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you
           this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your
           fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or
           the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for
           me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

06:024:016 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
           forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;

06:024:017 For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our
           fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
           and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
           in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people
           through whom we passed:

06:024:018 And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the
           Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve
           the LORD; for he is our God.

06:024:019 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
           he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
           your transgressions nor your sins.

06:024:020 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
           turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done
           you good.

06:024:021 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
           LORD.

06:024:022 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
           yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And
           they said, We are witnesses.

06:024:023 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
           among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.

06:024:024 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we
           serve, and his voice will we obey.

06:024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
           them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

06:024:026 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,
           and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that
           was by the sanctuary of the LORD.

06:024:027 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall
           be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the
           LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness
           unto you, lest ye deny your God.

06:024:028 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his
           inheritance.

06:024:029 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
           Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten
           years old.

06:024:030 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
           Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of
           the hill of Gaash.

06:024:031 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
           days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known
           all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.

06:024:032 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
           up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground
           which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem
           for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance
           of the children of Joseph.

06:024:033 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a
           hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him
           in mount Ephraim.

Book 07        Judges

07:001:001 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the
           children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for
           us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?

07:001:002 And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered
           the land into his hand.

07:001:003 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into
           my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I
           likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with
           him.

07:001:004 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and
           the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek
           ten thousand men.

07:001:005 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against
           him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

07:001:006 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught
           him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

07:001:007 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their
           thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under
           my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they
           brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.

07:001:008 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and
           had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and
           set the city on fire.

07:001:009 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
           the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south,
           and in the valley.

07:001:010 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
           (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew
           Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

07:001:011 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and
           the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:

07:001:012 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
           to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

07:001:013 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took
           it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

07:001:014 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him
           to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her
           ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?

07:001:015 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given
           me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave
           her the upper springs and the nether springs.

07:001:016 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up
           out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into
           the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and
           they went and dwelt among the people.

07:001:017 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
           Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
           And the name of the city was called Hormah.

07:001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with
           the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

07:001:019 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants
           of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of
           the valley, because they had chariots of iron.

07:001:020 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he
           expelled thence the three sons of Anak.

07:001:021 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
           that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the
           children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

07:001:022 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and
           the LORD was with them.

07:001:023 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name
           of the city before was Luz.)

07:001:024 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
           said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the
           city, and we will shew thee mercy.

07:001:025 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
           the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man
           and all his family.

07:001:026 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a
           city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name
           thereof unto this day.

07:001:027 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean
           and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants
           of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her
           towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the
           Canaanites would dwell in that land.

07:001:028 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
           Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

07:001:029 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in
           Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

07:001:030 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor
           the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among
           them, and became tributaries.

07:001:031 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
           inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
           Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:

07:001:032 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
           of the land: for they did not drive them out.

07:001:033 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
           nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the
           Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the
           inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries
           unto them.

07:001:034 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
           for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:

07:001:035 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
           Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so
           that they became tributaries.

07:001:036 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to
           Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

07:002:001 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and
           said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you
           unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I
           will never break my covenant with you.

07:002:002 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land;
           ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my
           voice: why have ye done this?

07:002:003 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before
           you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods
           shall be a snare unto you.

07:002:004 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these
           words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted
           up their voice, and wept.

07:002:005 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they
           sacrificed there unto the LORD.

07:002:006 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel
           went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

07:002:007 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all
           the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all
           the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

07:002:008 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died,
           being an hundred and ten years old.

07:002:009 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
           Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of
           the hill Gaash.

07:002:010 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
           and there arose another generation after them, which knew not
           the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.

07:002:011 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
           and served Baalim:

07:002:012 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought
           them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the
           gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed
           themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

07:002:013 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

07:002:014 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
           delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them,
           and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
           so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

07:002:015 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against
           them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn
           unto them: and they were greatly distressed.

07:002:016 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them
           out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

07:002:017 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
           went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto
           them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers
           walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did
           not so.

07:002:018 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was
           with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their
           enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD
           because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed
           them and vexed them.

07:002:019 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they
           returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in
           following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them;
           they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn
           way.

07:002:020 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
           Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
           commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;

07:002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of
           the nations which Joshua left when he died:

07:002:022 That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
           the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep
           it, or not.

07:002:023 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them
           out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of
           Joshua.

07:003:001 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel
           by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars
           of Canaan;

07:003:002 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might
           know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew
           nothing thereof;

07:003:003 Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
           and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount
           Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

07:003:004 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
           would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he
           commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

07:003:005 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
           Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and
           Jebusites:

07:003:006 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
           their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

07:003:007 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
           and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the
           groves.

07:003:008 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
           sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of
           Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served
           Chushanrishathaim eight years.

07:003:009 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
           raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered
           them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

07:003:010 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged
           Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered
           Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his
           hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.

07:003:011 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of
           Kenaz died.

07:003:012 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
           LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against
           Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

07:003:013 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and
           went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

07:003:014 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab
           eighteen years.

07:003:015 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
           raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite,
           a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a
           present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

07:003:016 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
           length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right
           thigh.

07:003:017 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon
           was a very fat man.

07:003:018 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
           the people that bare the present.

07:003:019 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
           Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king:
           who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out
           from him.

07:003:020 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer
           parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have
           a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.

07:003:021 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
           right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

07:003:022 And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
           upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of
           his belly; and the dirt came out.

07:003:023 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of
           the parlour upon him, and locked them.

07:003:024 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw
           that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said,
           Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

07:003:025 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he
           opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a
           key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down
           dead on the earth.

07:003:026 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
           quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

07:003:027 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet
           in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went
           down with him from the mount, and he before them.

07:003:028 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath
           delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they
           went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab,
           and suffered not a man to pass over.

07:003:029 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
           lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

07:003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
           land had rest fourscore years.

07:003:031 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
           Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also
           delivered Israel.

07:004:001 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
           LORD, when Ehud was dead.

07:004:002 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
           that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera,
           which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.

07:004:003 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had
           nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily
           oppressed the children of Israel.

07:004:004 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
           Israel at that time.

07:004:005 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
           Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to
           her for judgment.

07:004:006 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
           Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of
           Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and
           take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
           and of the children of Zebulun?

07:004:007 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the
           captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
           and I will deliver him into thine hand.

07:004:008 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will
           go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

07:004:009 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
           journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for
           the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And
           Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.

07:004:010 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went
           up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with
           him.

07:004:011 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
           father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites,
           and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by
           Kedesh.

07:004:012 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone
           up to mount Tabor.

07:004:013 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine
           hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with
           him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

07:004:014 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which
           the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the
           LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount
           Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

07:004:015 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
           his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that
           Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his
           feet.

07:004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
           Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell
           upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.

07:004:017 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the
           wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin
           the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

07:004:018 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in,
           my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in
           unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

07:004:019 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
           drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and
           gave him drink, and covered him.

07:004:020 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
           shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say,
           Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.

07:004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
           hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the
           nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he
           was fast asleep and weary. So he died.

07:004:022 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet
           him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man
           whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold,
           Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.

07:004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
           children of Israel.

07:004:024 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and
           prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had
           destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

07:005:001 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
           saying,

07:005:002 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people
           willingly offered themselves.

07:005:003 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
           unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.

07:005:004 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out
           of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens
           dropped, the clouds also dropped water.

07:005:005 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai
           from before the LORD God of Israel.

07:005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
           the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked
           through byways.

07:005:007 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
           until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

07:005:008 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a
           shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

07:005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered
           themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

07:005:010 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment,
           and walk by the way.

07:005:011 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the
           places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the
           righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the
           inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people
           of the LORD go down to the gates.

07:005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise,
           Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

07:005:013 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
           among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the
           mighty.

07:005:014 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
           thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down
           governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the
           writer.

07:005:015 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar,
           and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the
           divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.

07:005:016 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings
           of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great
           searchings of heart.

07:005:017 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
           Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

07:005:018 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
           unto the death in the high places of the field.

07:005:019 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
           Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

07:005:020 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
           against Sisera.

07:005:021 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
           river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

07:005:022 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
           the pransings of their mighty ones.

07:005:023 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly
           the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of
           the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.

07:005:024 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
           be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

07:005:025 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth
           butter in a lordly dish.

07:005:026 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the
           workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she
           smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through
           his temples.

07:005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he
           bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

07:005:028 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through
           the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry
           the wheels of his chariots?

07:005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to
           herself,

07:005:030 Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every
           man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a
           prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of
           needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take
           the spoil?

07:005:031 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that
           love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And
           the land had rest forty years.

07:006:001 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD:
           and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven
           years.

07:006:002 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because
           of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens
           which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

07:006:003 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came
           up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even
           they came up against them;

07:006:004 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of
           the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance
           for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

07:006:005 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they
           came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their
           camels were without number: and they entered into the land to
           destroy it.

07:006:006 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites;
           and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.

07:006:007 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto
           the LORD because of the Midianites,

07:006:008 That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel,
           which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I
           brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the
           house of bondage;

07:006:009 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out
           of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from
           before you, and gave you their land;

07:006:010 And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods
           of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not
           obeyed my voice.

07:006:011 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak
           which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite:
           and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it
           from the Midianites.

07:006:012 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto
           him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

07:006:013 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us,
           why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his
           miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the
           LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken
           us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

07:006:014 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might,
           and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites:
           have not I sent thee?

07:006:015 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save
           Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the
           least in my father's house.

07:006:016 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and
           thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

07:006:017 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
           then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

07:006:018 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and
           bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I
           will tarry until thou come again.

07:006:019 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
           of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put
           the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak,
           and presented it.

07:006:020 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
           unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out
           the broth. And he did so.

07:006:021 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that
           was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened
           cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed
           the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD
           departed out of his sight.

07:006:022 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,
           Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an
           angel of the LORD face to face.

07:006:023 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou
           shalt not die.

07:006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
           Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the
           Abiezrites.

07:006:025 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
           him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock
           of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy
           father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:

07:006:026 And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this
           rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and
           offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou
           shalt cut down.

07:006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD
           had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his
           father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not
           do it by day, that he did it by night.

07:006:028 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,
           behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut
           down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon
           the altar that was built.

07:006:029 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And
           when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of
           Joash hath done this thing.

07:006:030 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son,
           that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal,
           and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

07:006:031 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead
           for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let
           him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god,
           let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his
           altar.

07:006:032 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let
           Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

07:006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of
           the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in
           the valley of Jezreel.

07:006:034 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
           trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.

07:006:035 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
           gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and
           unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet
           them.

07:006:036 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine
           hand, as thou hast said,

07:006:037 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the
           dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth
           beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine
           hand, as thou hast said.

07:006:038 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust
           the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a
           bowl full of water.

07:006:039 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against
           me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee,
           but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the
           fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.

07:006:040 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece
           only, and there was dew on all the ground.

07:007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were
           with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod:
           so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of
           them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

07:007:002 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee
           are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands,
           lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand
           hath saved me.

07:007:003 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people,
           saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and
           depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the
           people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten
           thousand.

07:007:004 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many;
           bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee
           there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This
           shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of
           whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the
           same shall not go.

07:007:005 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD
           said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his
           tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself;
           likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.

07:007:006 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to
           their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the
           people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.

07:007:007 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that
           lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine
           hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his
           place.

07:007:008 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets:
           and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent,
           and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian
           was beneath him in the valley.

07:007:009 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
           him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered
           it into thine hand.

07:007:010 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant
           down to the host:

07:007:011 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine
           hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he
           down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men
           that were in the host.

07:007:012 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
           the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for
           multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand
           by the sea side for multitude.

07:007:013 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
           dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream,
           and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of
           Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and
           overturned it, that the tent lay along.

07:007:014 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save
           the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for
           into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

07:007:015 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
           the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned
           into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath
           delivered into your hand the host of Midian.

07:007:016 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and
           he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and
           lamps within the pitchers.

07:007:017 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and,
           behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be
           that, as I do, so shall ye do.

07:007:018 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then
           blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
           say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

07:007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto
           the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch;
           and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the
           trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.

07:007:020 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
           pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the
           trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried,
           The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

07:007:021 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp;
           and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

07:007:022 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set
           every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the
           host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the
           border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

07:007:023 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
           Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and
           pursued after the Midianites.

07:007:024 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim,
           saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them
           the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of
           Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto
           Bethbarah and Jordan.

07:007:025 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb;
           and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at
           the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the
           heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

07:008:001 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
           thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight
           with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.

07:008:002 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of
           you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
           the vintage of Abiezer?

07:008:003 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb
           and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then
           their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

07:008:004 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three
           hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

07:008:005 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves
           of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint,
           and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

07:008:006 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and
           Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto
           thine army?

07:008:007 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah
           and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with
           the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.

07:008:008 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise:
           and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had
           answered him.

07:008:009 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
           again in peace, I will break down this tower.

07:008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with
           them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all
           the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an
           hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.

07:008:011 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on
           the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the
           host was secure.

07:008:012 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and
           took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and
           discomfited all the host.

07:008:013 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the
           sun was up,

07:008:014 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of
           him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the
           elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.

07:008:015 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah
           and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the
           hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should
           give bread unto thy men that are weary?

07:008:016 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the
           wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
           Succoth.

07:008:017 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
           city.

07:008:018 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
           they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so
           were they; each one resembled the children of a king.

07:008:019 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my
           mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I
           would not slay you.

07:008:020 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But
           the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was
           yet a youth.

07:008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for
           as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew
           Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on
           their camels' necks.

07:008:022 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,
           both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast
           delivered us from the hand of Midian.

07:008:023 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
           shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.

07:008:024 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you,
           that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For
           they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

07:008:025 And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they
           spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings
           of his prey.

07:008:026 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
           thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments,
           and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of
           Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels'
           necks.

07:008:027 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even
           in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it:
           which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

07:008:028 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
           they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in
           quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.

07:008:029 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own
           house.

07:008:030 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten:
           for he had many wives.

07:008:031 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a
           son, whose name he called Abimelech.

07:008:032 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was
           buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the
           Abiezrites.

07:008:033 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
           children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after
           Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.

07:008:034 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God,
           who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies
           on every side:

07:008:035 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
           namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
           shewed unto Israel.

07:009:001 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
           mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the
           family of the house of his mother's father, saying,

07:009:002 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem,
           Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of
           Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over
           you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your
           bone and your flesh.

07:009:003 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the
           men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to
           follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.

07:009:004 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of
           the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and
           light persons, which followed him.

07:009:005 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his
           brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten
           persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the
           youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.

07:009:006 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the
           house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the
           plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.

07:009:007 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top
           of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said
           unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may
           hearken unto you.

07:009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
           they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

07:009:009 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
           wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted
           over the trees?

07:009:010 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over
           us.

07:009:011 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my
           sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the
           trees?

07:009:012 Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over
           us.

07:009:013 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
           cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

07:009:014 Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign
           over us.

07:009:015 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me
           king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and
           if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the
           cedars of Lebanon.

07:009:016 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye
           have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with
           Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to
           the deserving of his hands;

07:009:017 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far,
           and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:

07:009:018 And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and
           have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one
           stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant,
           king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)

07:009:019 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and
           with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let
           him also rejoice in you:

07:009:020 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the
           men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out
           from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and
           devour Abimelech.

07:009:021 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt
           there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.

07:009:022 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,

07:009:023 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of
           Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with
           Abimelech:

07:009:024 That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of
           Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech
           their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem,
           which aided him in the killing of his brethren.

07:009:025 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
           the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by
           them: and it was told Abimelech.

07:009:026 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over
           to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in
           him.

07:009:027 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their
           vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into
           the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed
           Abimelech.

07:009:028 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is
           Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of
           Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the
           father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?

07:009:029 And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I
           remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine
           army, and come out.

07:009:030 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
           the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

07:009:031 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
           Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and,
           behold, they fortify the city against thee.

07:009:032 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with
           thee, and lie in wait in the field:

07:009:033 And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is
           up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold,
           when he and the people that is with him come out against thee,
           then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.

07:009:034 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him,
           by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four
           companies.

07:009:035 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering
           of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people
           that were with him, from lying in wait.

07:009:036 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
           come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said
           unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they
           were men.

07:009:037 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by
           the middle of the land, and another company come along by the
           plain of Meonenim.

07:009:038 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith
           thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is
           not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray
           now, and fight with them.

07:009:039 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
           Abimelech.

07:009:040 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many
           were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the
           gate.

07:009:041 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and
           his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

07:009:042 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out
           into the field; and they told Abimelech.

07:009:043 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
           and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the
           people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against
           them, and smote them.

07:009:044 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed
           forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city:
           and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were
           in the fields, and slew them.

07:009:045 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he
           took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat
           down the city, and sowed it with salt.

07:009:046 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they
           entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.

07:009:047 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
           Shechem were gathered together.

07:009:048 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the
           people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his
           hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and
           laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were
           with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I
           have done.

07:009:049 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
           followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold
           on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem
           died also, about a thousand men and women.

07:009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
           and took it.

07:009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled
           all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it
           to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.

07:009:052 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and
           went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

07:009:053 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon
           Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.

07:009:054 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer,
           and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say
           not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him
           through, and he died.

07:009:055 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
           departed every man unto his place.

07:009:056 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
           unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

07:009:057 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon
           their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of
           Jerubbaal.

07:010:001 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son
           of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in
           Shamir in mount Ephraim.

07:010:002 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was
           buried in Shamir.

07:010:003 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel
           twenty and two years.

07:010:004 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they
           had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day,
           which are in the land of Gilead.

07:010:005 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

07:010:006 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
           LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria,
           and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of
           the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and
           forsook the LORD, and served not him.

07:010:007 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
           them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of
           the children of Ammon.

07:010:008 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
           eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the
           other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in
           Gilead.

07:010:009 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
           also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the
           house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.

07:010:010 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We
           have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our
           God, and also served Baalim.

07:010:011 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I
           deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from
           the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?

07:010:012 The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did
           oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of
           their hand.

07:010:013 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I
           will deliver you no more.

07:010:014 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them
           deliver you in the time of your tribulation.

07:010:015 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:
           do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us
           only, we pray thee, this day.

07:010:016 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served
           the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

07:010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and
           encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled
           themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.

07:010:018 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What
           man is he that will begin to fight against the children of
           Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

07:011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he
           was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.

07:011:002 And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up,
           and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt
           not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a
           strange woman.

07:011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of
           Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went
           out with him.

07:011:004 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of
           Ammon made war against Israel.

07:011:005 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war
           against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah
           out of the land of Tob:

07:011:006 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we
           may fight with the children of Ammon.

07:011:007 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate
           me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come
           unto me now when ye are in distress?

07:011:008 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn
           again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight
           against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the
           inhabitants of Gilead.

07:011:009 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me
           home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the
           LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?

07:011:010 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be
           witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.

07:011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
           made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all
           his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.

07:011:012 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of
           Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art
           come against me to fight in my land?

07:011:013 And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the
           messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when
           they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and
           unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again
           peaceably.

07:011:014 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the
           children of Ammon:

07:011:015 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away
           the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:

07:011:016 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
           wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;

07:011:017 Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let
           me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom
           would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto
           the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode
           in Kadesh.

07:011:018 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the
           land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
           of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
           but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the
           border of Moab.

07:011:019 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
           the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we
           pray thee, through thy land into my place.

07:011:020 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but
           Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz,
           and fought against Israel.

07:011:021 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people
           into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel
           possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of
           that country.

07:011:022 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
           even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

07:011:023 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites
           from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?

07:011:024 Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee
           to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out
           from before us, them will we possess.

07:011:025 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of
           Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or
           did he ever fight against them,

07:011:026 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and
           her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts
           of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not
           recover them within that time?

07:011:027 Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me
           wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day
           between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.

07:011:028 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto
           the words of Jephthah which he sent him.

07:011:029 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
           over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
           and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of
           Ammon.

07:011:030 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou
           shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine
           hands,

07:011:031 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of
           my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
           of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up
           for a burnt offering.

07:011:032 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
           against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.

07:011:033 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
           even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with
           a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were
           subdued before the children of Israel.

07:011:034 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
           daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances:
           and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor
           daughter.

07:011:035 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his
           clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me
           very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have
           opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.

07:011:036 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy
           mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath
           proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken
           vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of
           Ammon.

07:011:037 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me:
           let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the
           mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

07:011:038 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she
           went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the
           mountains.

07:011:039 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she
           returned unto her father, who did with her according to his
           vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a
           custom in Israel,

07:011:040 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the
           daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

07:012:001 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
           northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou
           over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not
           call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee
           with fire.

07:012:002 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great
           strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye
           delivered me not out of their hands.

07:012:003 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my
           hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the
           LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come
           up unto me this day, to fight against me?

07:012:004 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and
           fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim,
           because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim
           among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.

07:012:005 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
           Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which
           were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said
           unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

07:012:006 Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said
           Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then
           they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and
           there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two
           thousand.

07:012:007 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
           Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.

07:012:008 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

07:012:009 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
           abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.
           And he judged Israel seven years.

07:012:010 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

07:012:011 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
           Israel ten years.

07:012:012 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
           country of Zebulun.

07:012:013 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
           Israel.

07:012:014 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
           threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight
           years.

07:012:015 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was
           buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the
           Amalekites.

07:013:001 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
           LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the
           Philistines forty years.

07:013:002 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
           Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and
           bare not.

07:013:003 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said
           unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but
           thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.

07:013:004 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor
           strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:

07:013:005 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
           shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
           God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of
           the hand of the Philistines.

07:013:006 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
           came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of
           an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he
           was, neither told he me his name:

07:013:007 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a
           son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any
           unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from
           the womb to the day of his death.

07:013:008 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the
           man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach
           us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

07:013:009 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
           came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah
           her husband was not with her.

07:013:010 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and
           said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that
           came unto me the other day.

07:013:011 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the
           man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the
           woman? And he said, I am.

07:013:012 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we
           order the child, and how shall we do unto him?

07:013:013 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said
           unto the woman let her beware.

07:013:014 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
           let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing:
           all that I commanded her let her observe.

07:013:015 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let
           us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

07:013:016 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
           me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a
           burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah
           knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.

07:013:017 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
           that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

07:013:018 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus
           after my name, seeing it is secret?

07:013:019 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon
           a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and
           Manoah and his wife looked on.

07:013:020 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
           off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the
           flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and
           fell on their faces to the ground.

07:013:021 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
           his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

07:013:022 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we
           have seen God.

07:013:023 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill
           us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat
           offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all
           these things, nor would as at this time have told us such
           things as these.

07:013:024 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the
           child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

07:013:025 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the
           camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

07:014:001 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of
           the daughters of the Philistines.

07:014:002 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
           I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the
           Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

07:014:003 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a
           woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
           people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
           Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me;
           for she pleaseth me well.

07:014:004 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the
           LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for
           at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

07:014:005 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
           Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a
           young lion roared against him.

07:014:006 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent
           him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his
           hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had
           done.

07:014:007 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
           Samson well.

07:014:008 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside
           to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm
           of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.

07:014:009 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came
           to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat:
           but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the
           carcase of the lion.

07:014:010 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there
           a feast; for so used the young men to do.

07:014:011 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought
           thirty companions to be with him.

07:014:012 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto
           you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days
           of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty
           sheets and thirty change of garments:

07:014:013 But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty
           sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him,
           Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.

07:014:014 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and
           out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in
           three days expound the riddle.

07:014:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
           Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us
           the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with
           fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?

07:014:016 And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but
           hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto
           the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he
           said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my
           mother, and shall I tell it thee?

07:014:017 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast
           lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told
           her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to
           the children of her people.

07:014:018 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day
           before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what
           is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not
           plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

07:014:019 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
           Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil,
           and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the
           riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his
           father's house.

07:014:020 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used
           as his friend.

07:015:001 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
           harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said,
           I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would
           not suffer him to go in.

07:015:002 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
           hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her
           younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead
           of her.

07:015:003 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
           than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

07:015:004 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
           firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in
           the midst between two tails.

07:015:005 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into
           the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the
           shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and
           olives.

07:015:006 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they
           answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he
           had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the
           Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.

07:015:007 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will
           I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

07:015:008 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
           went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

07:015:009 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
           themselves in Lehi.

07:015:010 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And
           they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as
           he hath done to us.

07:015:011 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
           Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the
           Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast
           done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so
           have I done unto them.

07:015:012 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
           may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson
           said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me
           yourselves.

07:015:013 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee
           fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not
           kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought
           him up from the rock.

07:015:014 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against
           him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and
           the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was
           burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.

07:015:015 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,
           and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.

07:015:016 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
           with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

07:015:017 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
           he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that
           place Ramathlehi.

07:015:018 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said,
           Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy
           servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the
           hand of the uncircumcised?

07:015:019 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there
           came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came
           again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof
           Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.

07:015:020 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty
           years.

07:016:001 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in
           unto her.

07:016:002 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither.
           And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in
           the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In
           the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.

07:016:003 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took
           the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went
           away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders,
           and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before
           Hebron.

07:016:004 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
           valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

07:016:005 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said
           unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength
           lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we
           may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one
           of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

07:016:006 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
           great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to
           afflict thee.

07:016:007 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green
           withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as
           another man.

07:016:008 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven
           green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with
           them.

07:016:009 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the
           chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee,
           Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken
           when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.

07:016:010 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and
           told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou
           mightest be bound.

07:016:011 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that
           never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another
           man.

07:016:012 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and
           said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there
           were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them
           from off his arms like a thread.

07:016:013 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me,
           and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.
           And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my
           head with the web.

07:016:014 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
           Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his
           sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the
           web.

07:016:015 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
           thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three
           times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.

07:016:016 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her
           words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;

07:016:017 That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath
           not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite
           unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my
           strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like
           any other man.

07:016:018 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
           sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come
           up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the
           lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money
           in their hand.

07:016:019 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a
           man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his
           head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from
           him.

07:016:020 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
           awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other
           times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD
           was departed from him.

07:016:021 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and
           brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;
           and he did grind in the prison house.

07:016:022 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
           shaven.

07:016:023 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for
           to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to
           rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our
           enemy into our hand.

07:016:024 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they
           said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the
           destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.

07:016:025 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
           said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they
           called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them
           sport: and they set him between the pillars.

07:016:026 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer
           me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth,
           that I may lean upon them.

07:016:027 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
           the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about
           three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made
           sport.

07:016:028 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God,
           remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only
           this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
           Philistines for my two eyes.

07:016:029 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
           house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his
           right hand, and of the other with his left.

07:016:030 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
           himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords,
           and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which
           he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his
           life.

07:016:031 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down,
           and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah
           and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he
           judged Israel twenty years.

07:017:001 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

07:017:002 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of
           silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst,
           and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with
           me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the
           LORD, my son.

07:017:003 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver
           to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the
           silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven
           image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto
           thee.

07:017:004 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took
           two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder,
           who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they
           were in the house of Micah.

07:017:005 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
           teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his
           priest.

07:017:006 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did
           that which was right in his own eyes.

07:017:007 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family
           of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

07:017:008 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
           sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount
           Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

07:017:009 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
           him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn
           where I may find a place.

07:017:010 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a
           father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of
           silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.
           So the Levite went in.

07:017:011 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the
           young man was unto him as one of his sons.

07:017:012 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
           priest, and was in the house of Micah.

07:017:013 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,
           seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

07:018:001 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days
           the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell
           in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen
           unto them among the tribes of Israel.

07:018:002 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from
           their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to
           spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them,
           Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to
           the house of Micah, they lodged there.

07:018:003 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of
           the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said
           unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in
           this place? and what hast thou here?

07:018:004 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me,
           and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

07:018:005 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God,
           that we may know whether our way which we go shall be
           prosperous.

07:018:006 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is
           your way wherein ye go.

07:018:007 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the
           people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the
           manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no
           magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any
           thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no
           business with any man.

07:018:008 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and
           their brethren said unto them, What say ye?

07:018:009 And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we
           have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye
           still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the
           land.

07:018:010 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
           land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where
           there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.

07:018:011 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out
           of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with
           weapons of war.

07:018:012 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:
           wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day:
           behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.

07:018:013 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
           house of Micah.

07:018:014 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
           Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is
           in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image,
           and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.

07:018:015 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the
           young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and
           saluted him.

07:018:016 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
           which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of
           the gate.

07:018:017 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and
           came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and
           the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in
           the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were
           appointed with weapons of war.

07:018:018 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved
           image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then
           said the priest unto them, What do ye?

07:018:019 And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon
           thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:
           is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one
           man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in
           Israel?

07:018:020 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and
           the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of
           the people.

07:018:021 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
           cattle and the carriage before them.

07:018:022 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men
           that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered
           together, and overtook the children of Dan.

07:018:023 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
           faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest
           with such a company?

07:018:024 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the
           priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what
           is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?

07:018:025 And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be
           heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou
           lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.

07:018:026 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw
           that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back
           unto his house.

07:018:027 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest
           which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at
           quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the
           sword, and burnt the city with fire.

07:018:028 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and
           they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley
           that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt
           therein.

07:018:029 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of
           Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name
           of the city was Laish at the first.

07:018:030 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,
           the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were
           priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of
           the land.

07:018:031 And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all
           the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

07:019:001 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
           Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side
           of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of
           Bethlehemjudah.

07:019:002 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
           from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was
           there four whole months.

07:019:003 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly
           unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him,
           and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's
           house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced
           to meet him.

07:019:004 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and
           he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and
           lodged there.

07:019:005 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early
           in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's
           father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a
           morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.

07:019:006 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them
           together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be
           content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart
           be merry.

07:019:007 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged
           him: therefore he lodged there again.

07:019:008 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart;
           and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray
           thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both
           of them.

07:019:009 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
           his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto
           him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you
           tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge
           here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you
           early on your way, that thou mayest go home.

07:019:010 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
           departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and
           there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was
           with him.

07:019:011 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
           servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us
           turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

07:019:012 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither
           into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of
           Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.

07:019:013 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to
           one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in
           Ramah.

07:019:014 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
           upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to
           Benjamin.

07:019:015 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in
           Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of
           the city: for there was no man that took them into his house
           to lodging.

07:019:016 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
           field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he
           sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.

07:019:017 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
           the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest
           thou? and whence comest thou?

07:019:018 And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah
           toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went
           to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the
           LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.

07:019:019 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there
           is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for
           the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of
           any thing.

07:019:020 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all
           thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

07:019:021 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
           asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

07:019:022 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
           the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about,
           and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house,
           the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine
           house, that we may know him.

07:019:023 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
           said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so
           wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not
           this folly.

07:019:024 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them
           I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them
           what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a
           thing.

07:019:025 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
           concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her,
           and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the
           day began to spring, they let her go.

07:019:026 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down
           at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was
           light.

07:019:027 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
           the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman
           his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and
           her hands were upon the threshold.

07:019:028 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
           answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man
           rose up, and gat him unto his place.

07:019:029 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
           hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her
           bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of
           Israel.

07:019:030 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such
           deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel
           came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of
           it, take advice, and speak your minds.

07:020:001 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
           was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba,
           with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

07:020:002 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of
           Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of
           God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.

07:020:003 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of
           Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of
           Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?

07:020:004 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain,
           answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to
           Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

07:020:005 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
           round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me:
           and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.

07:020:006 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
           throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for
           they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

07:020:007 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice
           and counsel.

07:020:008 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any
           of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his
           house.

07:020:009 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we
           will go up by lot against it;

07:020:010 And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the
           tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand
           out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that
           they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according
           to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

07:020:011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
           together as one man.

07:020:012 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
           Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among
           you?

07:020:013 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial,
           which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put
           away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not
           hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.

07:020:014 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out
           of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the
           children of Israel.

07:020:015 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of
           the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside
           the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred
           chosen men.

07:020:016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
           lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth,
           and not miss.

07:020:017 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
           hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of
           war.

07:020:018 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
           God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go
           up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And
           the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.

07:020:019 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and
           encamped against Gibeah.

07:020:020 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and
           the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against
           them at Gibeah.

07:020:021 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and
           destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty
           and two thousand men.

07:020:022 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and
           set their battle again in array in the place where they put
           themselves in array the first day.

07:020:023 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD
           until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go
           up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my
           brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)

07:020:024 And the children of Israel came near against the children of
           Benjamin the second day.

07:020:025 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
           day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of
           Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

07:020:026 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
           and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before
           the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt
           offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

07:020:027 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark
           of the covenant of God was there in those days,

07:020:028 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood
           before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to
           battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
           cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver
           them into thine hand.

07:020:029 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

07:020:030 And the children of Israel went up against the children of
           Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against
           Gibeah, as at other times.

07:020:031 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and
           were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the
           people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which
           one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in
           the field, about thirty men of Israel.

07:020:032 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down
           before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said,
           Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.

07:020:033 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
           themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of
           Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows
           of Gibeah.

07:020:034 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of
           all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that
           evil was near them.

07:020:035 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
           Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five
           thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.

07:020:036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for
           the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they
           trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside
           Gibeah.

07:020:037 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
           liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city
           with the edge of the sword.

07:020:038 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
           the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with
           smoke rise up out of the city.

07:020:039 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin
           began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty
           persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before
           us, as in the first battle.

07:020:040 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
           pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and,
           behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.

07:020:041 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin
           were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.

07:020:042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel
           unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them;
           and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the
           midst of them.

07:020:043 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased
           them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward
           the sunrising.

07:020:044 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these
           were men of valour.

07:020:045 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock
           of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five
           thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew
           two thousand men of them.

07:020:046 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and
           five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of
           valour.

07:020:047 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
           rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

07:020:048 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
           Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well
           the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to
           hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

07:021:001 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall
           not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

07:021:002 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till
           even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;

07:021:003 And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in
           Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in
           Israel?

07:021:004 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early,
           and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and
           peace offerings.

07:021:005 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the
           tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto
           the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that
           came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be
           put to death.

07:021:006 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
           brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this
           day.

07:021:007 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
           sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters
           to wives?

07:021:008 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that
           came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came
           none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.

07:021:009 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of
           the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.

07:021:010 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
           valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the
           inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with
           the women and the children.

07:021:011 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly
           destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

07:021:012 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
           hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any
           male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is
           in the land of Canaan.

07:021:013 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children
           of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call
           peaceably unto them.

07:021:014 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives
           which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and
           yet so they sufficed them not.

07:021:015 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the
           LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

07:021:016 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
           wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out
           of Benjamin?

07:021:017 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be
           escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of
           Israel.

07:021:018 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
           children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that
           giveth a wife to Benjamin.

07:021:019 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
           yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the
           east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem,
           and on the south of Lebonah.

07:021:020 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go
           and lie in wait in the vineyards;

07:021:021 And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to
           dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch
           you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to
           the land of Benjamin.

07:021:022 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come
           unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable
           unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man
           his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this
           time, that ye should be guilty.

07:021:023 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
           according to their number, of them that danced, whom they
           caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and
           repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.

07:021:024 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
           man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from
           thence every man to his inheritance.

07:021:025 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that
           which was right in his own eyes.

Book 08        Ruth

08:001:001 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
           there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of
           Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and
           his wife, and his two sons.

08:001:002 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his
           wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
           Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country
           of Moab, and continued there.

08:001:003 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
           two sons.

08:001:004 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the
           one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they
           dwelled there about ten years.

08:001:005 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman
           was left of her two sons and her husband.

08:001:006 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
           return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the
           country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in
           giving them bread.

08:001:007 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and
           her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to
           return unto the land of Judah.

08:001:008 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each
           to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye
           have dealt with the dead, and with me.

08:001:009 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the
           house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up
           their voice, and wept.

08:001:010 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto
           thy people.

08:001:011 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
           me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be
           your husbands?

08:001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to
           have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should
           have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;

08:001:013 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay
           for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it
           grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is
           gone out against me.

08:001:014 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
           kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

08:001:015 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
           people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in
           law.

08:001:016 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
           following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
           where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
           people, and thy God my God:

08:001:017 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the
           LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee
           and me.

08:001:018 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her,
           then she left speaking unto her.

08:001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
           pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was
           moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

08:001:020 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for
           the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

08:001:021 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
           why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified
           against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?

08:001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in
           law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and
           they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

08:002:001 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of
           wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

08:002:002 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
           field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall
           find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

08:002:003 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
           reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field
           belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

08:002:004 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the
           reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD
           bless thee.

08:002:005 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
           Whose damsel is this?

08:002:006 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and
           said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out
           of the country of Moab:

08:002:007 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the
           reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued
           even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in
           the house.

08:002:008 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
           not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but
           abide here fast by my maidens:

08:002:009 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou
           after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall
           not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the
           vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.

08:002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
           and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that
           thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?

08:002:011 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed
           me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the
           death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and
           thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
           people which thou knewest not heretofore.

08:002:012 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee
           of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to
           trust.

08:002:013 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for
           that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
           friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of
           thine handmaidens.

08:002:014 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat
           of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat
           beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she
           did eat, and was sufficed, and left.

08:002:015 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young
           men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and
           reproach her not:

08:002:016 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
           leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

08:002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she
           had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.

08:002:018 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in
           law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave
           to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.

08:002:019 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
           to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take
           knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom
           she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought
           to day is Boaz.

08:002:020 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
           LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to
           the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto
           us, one of our next kinsmen.

08:002:021 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt
           keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my
           harvest.

08:002:022 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
           daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet
           thee not in any other field.

08:002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end
           of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her
           mother in law.

08:003:001 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall
           I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?

08:003:002 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou
           wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the
           threshingfloor.

08:003:003 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment
           upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not
           thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating
           and drinking.

08:003:004 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
           place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover
           his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
           shalt do.

08:003:005 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

08:003:006 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all
           that her mother in law bade her.

08:003:007 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he
           went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came
           softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

08:003:008 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
           turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.

08:003:009 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
           handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for
           thou art a near kinsman.

08:003:010 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for
           thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the
           beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether
           poor or rich.

08:003:011 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that
           thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that
           thou art a virtuous woman.

08:003:012 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there
           is a kinsman nearer than I.

08:003:013 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he
           will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do
           the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a
           kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee,
           as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.

08:003:014 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up
           before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be
           known that a woman came into the floor.

08:003:015 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and
           hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of
           barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.

08:003:016 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art
           thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done
           to her.

08:003:017 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
           said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

08:003:018 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
           matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he
           have finished the thing this day.

08:004:001 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
           behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he
           said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned
           aside, and sat down.

08:004:002 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit
           ye down here. And they sat down.

08:004:003 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of
           the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our
           brother Elimelech's:

08:004:004 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the
           inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
           redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then
           tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it
           beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem
           it.

08:004:005 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
           Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife
           of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his
           inheritance.

08:004:006 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I
           mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for
           I cannot redeem it.

08:004:007 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
           redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things;
           a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and
           this was a testimony in Israel.

08:004:008 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he
           drew off his shoe.

08:004:009 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
           witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was
           Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the
           hand of Naomi.

08:004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
           purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon
           his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from
           among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are
           witnesses this day.

08:004:011 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders,
           said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come
           into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did
           build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah,
           and be famous in Bethlehem:

08:004:012 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
           unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this
           young woman.

08:004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in
           unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

08:004:014 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath
           not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be
           famous in Israel.

08:004:015 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a
           nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which
           loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath
           born him.

08:004:016 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
           nurse unto it.

08:004:017 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is
           a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the
           father of Jesse, the father of David.

08:004:018 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

08:004:019 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,

08:004:020 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

08:004:021 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

08:004:022 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

Book 09        1 Samuel

09:001:001 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount
           Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son
           of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

09:001:002 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the
           name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but
           Hannah had no children.

09:001:003 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
           sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons
           of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were
           there.

09:001:004 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to
           Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters,
           portions:

09:001:005 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah:
           but the LORD had shut up her womb.

09:001:006 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her
           fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.

09:001:007 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house
           of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did
           not eat.

09:001:008 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest
           thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?
           am not I better to thee than ten sons?

09:001:009 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
           they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post
           of the temple of the LORD.

09:001:010 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD,
           and wept sore.

09:001:011 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
           indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember
           me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine
           handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all
           the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his
           head.

09:001:012 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
           that Eli marked her mouth.

09:001:013 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but
           her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been
           drunken.

09:001:014 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away
           thy wine from thee.

09:001:015 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
           sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
           but have poured out my soul before the LORD.

09:001:016 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of
           the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken
           hitherto.

09:001:017 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
           grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

09:001:018 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So
           the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was
           no more sad.

09:001:019 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before
           the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and
           Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

09:001:020 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
           Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name
           Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.

09:001:021 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto
           the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

09:001:022 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will
           not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring
           him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for
           ever.

09:001:023 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
           good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD
           establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck
           until she weaned him.

09:001:024 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
           three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
           and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the
           child was young.

09:001:025 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

09:001:026 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am
           the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

09:001:027 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my
           petition which I asked of him:

09:001:028 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he
           liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the
           LORD there.

09:002:001 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,
           mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over
           mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.

09:002:002 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:
           neither is there any rock like our God.

09:002:003 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
           of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him
           actions are weighed.

09:002:004 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled
           are girded with strength.

09:002:005 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and
           they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born
           seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

09:002:006 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the
           grave, and bringeth up.

09:002:007 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
           lifteth up.

09:002:008 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the
           beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to
           make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the
           earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.

09:002:009 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
           silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

09:002:010 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of
           heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the
           ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king,
           and exalt the horn of his anointed.

09:002:011 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
           minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

09:002:012 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the
           LORD.

09:002:013 And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any
           man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the
           flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his
           hand;

09:002:014 And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
           all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself.
           So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came
           thither.

09:002:015 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and
           said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the
           priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

09:002:016 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the
           fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth;
           then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now:
           and if not, I will take it by force.

09:002:017 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
           LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.

09:002:018 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded
           with a linen ephod.

09:002:019 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to
           him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to
           offer the yearly sacrifice.

09:002:020 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give
           thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the
           LORD. And they went unto their own home.

09:002:021 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
           three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before
           the LORD.

09:002:022 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
           Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the
           door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

09:002:023 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of
           your evil dealings by all this people.

09:002:024 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make
           the LORD's people to transgress.

09:002:025 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but
           if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?
           Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their
           father, because the LORD would slay them.

09:002:026 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
           LORD, and also with men.

09:002:027 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
           saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy
           father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?

09:002:028 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my
           priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an
           ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father
           all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

09:002:029 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which
           I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons
           above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the
           offerings of Israel my people?

09:002:030 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy
           house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for
           ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that
           honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be
           lightly esteemed.

09:002:031 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the
           arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man
           in thine house.

09:002:032 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the
           wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an
           old man in thine house for ever.

09:002:033 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine
           altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine
           heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the
           flower of their age.

09:002:034 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy
           two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die
           both of them.

09:002:035 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
           according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I
           will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine
           anointed for ever.

09:002:036 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in
           thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver
           and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee,
           into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of
           bread.

09:003:001 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And
           the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no
           open vision.

09:003:002 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in
           his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not
           see;

09:003:003 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD,
           where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;

09:003:004 That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.

09:003:005 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst
           me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and
           lay down.

09:003:006 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and
           went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And
           he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.

09:003:007 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of
           the LORD yet revealed unto him.

09:003:008 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose
           and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.
           And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.

09:003:009 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be,
           if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy
           servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

09:003:010 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
           Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
           heareth.

09:003:011 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in
           Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it
           shall tingle.

09:003:012 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
           spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an
           end.

09:003:013 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for
           the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made
           themselves vile, and he restrained them not.

09:003:014 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
           iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor
           offering for ever.

09:003:015 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
           house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

09:003:016 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
           answered, Here am I.

09:003:017 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto
           thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and
           more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things
           that he said unto thee.

09:003:018 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And
           he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.

09:003:019 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none
           of his words fall to the ground.

09:003:020 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
           established to be a prophet of the LORD.

09:003:021 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
           himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

09:004:001 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
           against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside
           Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.

09:004:002 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
           and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the
           Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four
           thousand men.

09:004:003 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
           Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before
           the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it
           may save us out of the hand of our enemies.

09:004:004 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from
           thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which
           dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli,
           Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant
           of God.

09:004:005 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the
           camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth
           rang again.

09:004:006 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they
           said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp
           of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD
           was come into the camp.

09:004:007 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
           into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not
           been such a thing heretofore.

09:004:008 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these
           mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with
           all the plagues in the wilderness.

09:004:009 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that
           ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you:
           quit yourselves like men, and fight.

09:004:010 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they
           fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great
           slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

09:004:011 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
           and Phinehas, were slain.

09:004:012 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
           Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon
           his head.

09:004:013 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
           watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when
           the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried
           out.

09:004:014 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What
           meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily,
           and told Eli.

09:004:015 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
           that he could not see.

09:004:016 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army,
           and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there
           done, my son?

09:004:017 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the
           Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among
           the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are
           dead, and the ark of God is taken.

09:004:018 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,
           that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the
           gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man,
           and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.

09:004:019 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near
           to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark
           of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband
           were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came
           upon her.

09:004:020 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her
           said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she
           answered not, neither did she regard it.

09:004:021 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
           from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of
           her father in law and her husband.

09:004:022 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark
           of God is taken.

09:005:001 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
           Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

09:005:002 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into
           the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

09:005:003 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold,
           Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of
           the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.

09:005:004 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon
           was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the
           LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands
           were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was
           left to him.

09:005:005 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
           Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto
           this day.

09:005:006 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
           destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and
           the coasts thereof.

09:005:007 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The
           ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand
           is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.

09:005:008 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the
           Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark
           of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the
           God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the
           ark of the God of Israel about thither.

09:005:009 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand
           of the LORD was against the city with a very great
           destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and
           great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.

09:005:010 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to
           pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites
           cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God
           of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.

09:005:011 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
           Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel,
           and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and
           our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all
           the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.

09:005:012 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and
           the cry of the city went up to heaven.

09:006:001 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
           seven months.

09:006:002 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
           saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us
           wherewith we shall send it to his place.

09:006:003 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel,
           send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass
           offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to
           you why his hand is not removed from you.

09:006:004 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we
           shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and
           five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the
           Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.

09:006:005 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of
           your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the
           God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off
           you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.

09:006:006 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
           Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully
           among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?

09:006:007 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on
           which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart,
           and bring their calves home from them:

09:006:008 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and
           put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass
           offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,
           that it may go.

09:006:009 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
           Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not,
           then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it
           was a chance that happened to us.

09:006:010 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to
           the cart, and shut up their calves at home:

09:006:011 And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the
           coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.

09:006:012 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh,
           and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned
           not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of
           the Philistines went after them unto the border of
           Bethshemesh.

09:006:013 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in
           the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark,
           and rejoiced to see it.

09:006:014 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
           stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the
           wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto
           the LORD.

09:006:015 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
           that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put
           them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered
           burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto
           the LORD.

09:006:016 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
           returned to Ekron the same day.

09:006:017 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines
           returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod
           one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron
           one;

09:006:018 And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
           of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced
           cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of
           Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone
           remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the
           Bethshemite.

09:006:019 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked
           into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty
           thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented,
           because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great
           slaughter.

09:006:020 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before
           this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

09:006:021 And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim,
           saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the
           LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.

09:007:001 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of
           the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the
           hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the
           LORD.

09:007:002 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim,
           that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the
           house of Israel lamented after the LORD.

09:007:003 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye
           do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away
           the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare
           your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will
           deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

09:007:004 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
           and served the LORD only.

09:007:005 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray
           for you unto the LORD.

09:007:006 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and
           poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and
           said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged
           the children of Israel in Mizpeh.

09:007:007 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel
           were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines
           went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard
           it, they were afraid of the Philistines.

09:007:008 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry
           unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the
           hand of the Philistines.

09:007:009 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
           offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD
           for Israel; and the LORD heard him.

09:007:010 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
           Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD
           thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the
           Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten
           before Israel.

09:007:011 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
           Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.

09:007:012 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen,
           and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the
           LORD helped us.

09:007:013 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into
           the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the
           Philistines all the days of Samuel.

09:007:014 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel
           were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the
           coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the
           Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the
           Amorites.

09:007:015 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

09:007:016 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and
           Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

09:007:017 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and
           there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the
           LORD.

09:008:001 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his
           sons judges over Israel.

09:008:002 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
           second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

09:008:003 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after
           lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

09:008:004 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
           and came to Samuel unto Ramah,

09:008:005 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not
           in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the
           nations.

09:008:006 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a
           king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

09:008:007 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
           people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not
           rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not
           reign over them.

09:008:008 According to all the works which they have done since the day
           that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day,
           wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do
           they also unto thee.

09:008:009 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
           solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that
           shall reign over them.

09:008:010 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
           asked of him a king.

09:008:011 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall
           reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for
           himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some
           shall run before his chariots.

09:008:012 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
           over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap
           his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
           instruments of his chariots.

09:008:013 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to
           be cooks, and to be bakers.

09:008:014 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
           oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his
           servants.

09:008:015 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your
           vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

09:008:016 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
           your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his
           work.

09:008:017 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
           servants.

09:008:018 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
           shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that
           day.

09:008:019 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;
           and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;

09:008:020 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king
           may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

09:008:021 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
           them in the ears of the LORD.

09:008:022 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and
           make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go
           ye every man unto his city.

09:009:001 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son
           of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of
           Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

09:009:002 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and
           a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a
           goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was
           higher than any of the people.

09:009:003 And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said
           to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and
           arise, go seek the asses.

09:009:004 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the
           land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed
           through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he
           passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them
           not.

09:009:005 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
           servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my
           father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.

09:009:006 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man
           of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh
           surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can
           shew us our way that we should go.

09:009:007 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what
           shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
           and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what
           have we?

09:009:008 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have
           here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will
           I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.

09:009:009 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus
           he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now
           called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

09:009:010 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So
           they went unto the city where the man of God was.

09:009:011 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
           maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the
           seer here?

09:009:012 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before
           you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there
           is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:

09:009:013 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find
           him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people
           will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the
           sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now
           therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

09:009:014 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into
           the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up
           to the high place.

09:009:015 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul
           came, saying,

09:009:016 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the
           land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over
           my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand
           of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because
           their cry is come unto me.

09:009:017 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the
           man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my
           people.

09:009:018 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me,
           I pray thee, where the seer's house is.

09:009:019 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up
           before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to
           day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all
           that is in thine heart.

09:009:020 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not
           thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the
           desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's
           house?

09:009:021 And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the
           smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of
           all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then
           speakest thou so to me?

09:009:022 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into
           the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among
           them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.

09:009:023 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave
           thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

09:009:024 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,
           and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is
           left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it
           been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So
           Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

09:009:025 And when they were come down from the high place into the
           city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

09:009:026 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of
           the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house,
           saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and
           they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.

09:009:027 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel
           said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he
           passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee
           the word of God.

09:010:001 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head,
           and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath
           anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

09:010:002 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find
           two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at
           Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou
           wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the
           care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I
           do for my son?

09:010:003 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come
           to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men
           going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and
           another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a
           bottle of wine:

09:010:004 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;
           which thou shalt receive of their hands.

09:010:005 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the
           garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when
           thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a
           company of prophets coming down from the high place with a
           psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;
           and they shall prophesy:

09:010:006 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt
           prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

09:010:007 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou
           do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.

09:010:008 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I
           will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to
           sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou
           tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.

09:010:009 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
           Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came
           to pass that day.

09:010:010 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
           prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
           prophesied among them.

09:010:011 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw
           that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the
           people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the
           son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?

09:010:012 And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their
           father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the
           prophets?

09:010:013 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the
           high place.

09:010:014 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither
           went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that
           they were no where, we came to Samuel.

09:010:015 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
           unto you.

09:010:016 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the
           asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof
           Samuel spake, he told him not.

09:010:017 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;

09:010:018 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God
           of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you
           out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
           kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:

09:010:019 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you
           out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have
           said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore
           present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your
           thousands.

09:010:020 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
           near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

09:010:021 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
           families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of
           Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be
           found.

09:010:022 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should
           yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid
           himself among the stuff.

09:010:023 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among
           the people, he was higher than any of the people from his
           shoulders and upward.

09:010:024 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD
           hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?
           And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.

09:010:025 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and
           wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel
           sent all the people away, every man to his house.

09:010:026 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
           band of men, whose hearts God had touched.

09:010:027 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?
           And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held
           his peace.

09:011:001 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
           Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make
           a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.

09:011:002 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will
           I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your
           right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.

09:011:003 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'
           respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of
           Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come
           out to thee.

09:011:004 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the
           tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted
           up their voices, and wept.

09:011:005 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and
           Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they
           told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.

09:011:006 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those
           tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.

09:011:007 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
           them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of
           messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and
           after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear
           of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one
           consent.

09:011:008 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel
           were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty
           thousand.

09:011:009 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
           unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun
           be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed
           it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.

09:011:010 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
           unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto
           you.

09:011:011 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
           companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the
           morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the
           day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were
           scattered, so that two of them were not left together.

09:011:012 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall
           Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to
           death.

09:011:013 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:
           for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

09:011:014 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
           and renew the kingdom there.

09:011:015 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul
           king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed
           sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul
           and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

09:012:001 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
           your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king
           over you.

09:012:002 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
           grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have
           walked before you from my childhood unto this day.

09:012:003 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and
           before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have
           I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or
           of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes
           therewith? and I will restore it you.

09:012:004 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
           neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

09:012:005 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and
           his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought
           in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.

09:012:006 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced
           Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the
           land of Egypt.

09:012:007 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before
           the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did
           to you and to your fathers.

09:012:008 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto
           the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought
           forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this
           place.

09:012:009 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the
           hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the
           hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of
           Moab, and they fought against them.

09:012:010 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned,
           because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and
           Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies,
           and we will serve thee.

09:012:011 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
           Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on
           every side, and ye dwelled safe.

09:012:012 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
           came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign
           over us: when the LORD your God was your king.

09:012:013 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye
           have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.

09:012:014 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice,
           and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall
           both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue
           following the LORD your God:

09:012:015 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel
           against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of
           the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.

09:012:016 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD
           will do before your eyes.

09:012:017 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
           he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see
           that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight
           of the LORD, in asking you a king.

09:012:018 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and
           rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and
           Samuel.

09:012:019 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants
           unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto
           all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.

09:012:020 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all
           this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD,
           but serve the LORD with all your heart;

09:012:021 And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain
           things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.

09:012:022 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's
           sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.

09:012:023 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
           LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good
           and the right way:

09:012:024 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your
           heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.

09:012:025 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both
           ye and your king.

09:013:001 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
           Israel,

09:013:002 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two
           thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a
           thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the
           rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.

09:013:003 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
           Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the
           trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

09:013:004 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of
           the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination
           with the Philistines. And the people were called together
           after Saul to Gilgal.

09:013:005 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
           Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,
           and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude:
           and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from
           Bethaven.

09:013:006 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for
           the people were distressed,) then the people did hide
           themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in
           high places, and in pits.

09:013:007 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad
           and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the
           people followed him trembling.

09:013:008 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that
           Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the
           people were scattered from him.

09:013:009 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
           offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

09:013:010 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
           offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul
           went out to meet him, that he might salute him.

09:013:011 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
           saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou
           camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines
           gathered themselves together at Michmash;

09:013:012 Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me
           to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I
           forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.

09:013:013 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast
           not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he
           commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy
           kingdom upon Israel for ever.

09:013:014 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought
           him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him
           to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that
           which the LORD commanded thee.

09:013:015 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
           Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with
           him, about six hundred men.

09:013:016 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were
           present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the
           Philistines encamped in Michmash.

09:013:017 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
           three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth
           to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:

09:013:018 And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another
           company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the
           valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

09:013:019 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of
           Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them
           swords or spears:

09:013:020 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to
           sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and
           his mattock.

09:013:021 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters,
           and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

09:013:022 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was
           neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people
           that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with
           Jonathan his son was there found.

09:013:023 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
           Michmash.

09:014:001 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
           said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us
           go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other
           side. But he told not his father.

09:014:002 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
           pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were
           with him were about six hundred men;

09:014:003 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of
           Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing
           an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.

09:014:004 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
           unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the
           one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of
           the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

09:014:005 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
           Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.

09:014:006 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
           and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised:
           it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no
           restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.

09:014:007 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
           heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy
           heart.

09:014:008 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men,
           and we will discover ourselves unto them.

09:014:009 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
           will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

09:014:010 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
           the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be
           a sign unto us.

09:014:011 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of
           the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews
           come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

09:014:012 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
           armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a
           thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after
           me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

09:014:013 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
           his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and
           his armourbearer slew after him.

09:014:014 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
           made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of
           land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.

09:014:015 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among
           all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also
           trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great
           trembling.

09:014:016 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
           behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating
           down one another.

09:014:017 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
           and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered,
           behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.

09:014:018 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
           ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

09:014:019 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that
           the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and
           increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

09:014:020 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
           themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every
           man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great
           discomfiture.

09:014:021 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before
           that time, which went up with them into the camp from the
           country round about, even they also turned to be with the
           Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

09:014:022 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in
           mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even
           they also followed hard after them in the battle.

09:014:023 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over
           unto Bethaven.

09:014:024 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
           adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any
           food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So
           none of the people tasted any food.

09:014:025 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
           upon the ground.

09:014:026 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
           dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people
           feared the oath.

09:014:027 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
           the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was
           in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand
           to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.

09:014:028 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
           charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man
           that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.

09:014:029 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
           pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I
           tasted a little of this honey.

09:014:030 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
           the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not
           been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

09:014:031 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to
           Aijalon: and the people were very faint.

09:014:032 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
           and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did
           eat them with the blood.

09:014:033 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against
           the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye
           have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.

09:014:034 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
           unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his
           sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the
           LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought
           every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.

09:014:035 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
           altar that he built unto the LORD.

09:014:036 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
           and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a
           man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto
           thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.

09:014:037 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
           Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?
           But he answered him not that day.

09:014:038 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the
           people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

09:014:039 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
           Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man
           among all the people that answered him.

09:014:040 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
           Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said
           unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.

09:014:041 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a
           perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people
           escaped.

09:014:042 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
           Jonathan was taken.

09:014:043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
           Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey
           with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must
           die.

09:014:044 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
           surely die, Jonathan.

09:014:045 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
           wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the
           LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the
           ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people
           rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

09:014:046 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
           Philistines went to their own place.

09:014:047 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all
           his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the
           children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of
           Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he
           turned himself, he vexed them.

09:014:048 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and
           delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

09:014:049 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
           and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the
           firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

09:014:050 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of
           Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner,
           the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.

09:014:051 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner
           was the son of Abiel.

09:014:052 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
           Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he
           took him unto him.

09:015:001 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to
           be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken
           thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.

09:015:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did
           to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came
           up from Egypt.

09:015:003 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they
           have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant
           and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

09:015:004 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
           Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of
           Judah.

09:015:005 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the
           valley.

09:015:006 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
           among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye
           shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came
           up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the
           Amalekites.

09:015:007 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest
           to Shur, that is over against Egypt.

09:015:008 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
           destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

09:015:009 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the
           sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs,
           and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but
           every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed
           utterly.

09:015:010 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,

09:015:011 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is
           turned back from following me, and hath not performed my
           commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the
           LORD all night.

09:015:012 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
           told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set
           him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone
           down to Gilgal.

09:015:013 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be
           thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the
           LORD.

09:015:014 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep
           in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

09:015:015 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for
           the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to
           sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly
           destroyed.

09:015:016 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what
           the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say
           on.

09:015:017 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight,
           wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the
           LORD anointed thee king over Israel?

09:015:018 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly
           destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them
           until they be consumed.

09:015:019 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but
           didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the
           LORD?

09:015:020 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
           LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have
           brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed
           the Amalekites.

09:015:021 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
           the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to
           sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

09:015:022 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
           offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD?
           Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than
           the fat of rams.

09:015:023 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
           as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word
           of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

09:015:024 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
           transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words:
           because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.

09:015:025 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
           me, that I may worship the LORD.

09:015:026 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for
           thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath
           rejected thee from being king over Israel.

09:015:027 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
           skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

09:015:028 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
           Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of
           thine, that is better than thou.

09:015:029 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for
           he is not a man, that he should repent.

09:015:030 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
           before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn
           again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.

09:015:031 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the
           LORD.

09:015:032 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
           Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said,
           Surely the bitterness of death is past.

09:015:033 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
           shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed
           Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

09:015:034 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
           Gibeah of Saul.

09:015:035 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his
           death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD
           repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

09:016:001 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for
           Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?
           fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse
           the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his
           sons.

09:016:002 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill
           me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am
           come to sacrifice to the LORD.

09:016:003 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what
           thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name
           unto thee.

09:016:004 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to
           Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming,
           and said, Comest thou peaceably?

09:016:005 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:
           sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he
           sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the
           sacrifice.

09:016:006 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
           Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.

09:016:007 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or
           on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for
           the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the
           outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.

09:016:008 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
           And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

09:016:009 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath
           the LORD chosen this.

09:016:010 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
           Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

09:016:011 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
           said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he
           keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch
           him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

09:016:012 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal
           of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the
           LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.

09:016:013 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the
           midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon
           David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to
           Ramah.

09:016:014 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
           spirit from the LORD troubled him.

09:016:015 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
           from God troubleth thee.

09:016:016 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee,
           to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it
           shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon
           thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be
           well.

09:016:017 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
           play well, and bring him to me.

09:016:018 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have
           seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in
           playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and
           prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with
           him.

09:016:019 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
           David thy son, which is with the sheep.

09:016:020 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
           and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.

09:016:021 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
           greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

09:016:022 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
           before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

09:016:023 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
           Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so
           Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed
           from him.

09:017:001 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
           and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to
           Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

09:017:002 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
           pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array
           against the Philistines.

09:017:003 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
           Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a
           valley between them.

09:017:004 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the
           Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six
           cubits and a span.

09:017:005 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
           with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five
           thousand shekels of brass.

09:017:006 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of
           brass between his shoulders.

09:017:007 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his
           spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one
           bearing a shield went before him.

09:017:008 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said
           unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am
           not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man
           for you, and let him come down to me.

09:017:009 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we
           be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him,
           then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.

09:017:010 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
           give me a man, that we may fight together.

09:017:011 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
           they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

09:017:012 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
           whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went
           among men for an old man in the days of Saul.

09:017:013 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to
           the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the
           battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab,
           and the third Shammah.

09:017:014 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed
           Saul.

09:017:015 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's
           sheep at Bethlehem.

09:017:016 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and
           presented himself forty days.

09:017:017 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren
           an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run
           to the camp of thy brethren;

09:017:018 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their
           thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their
           pledge.

09:017:019 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
           valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

09:017:020 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep
           with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him;
           and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the
           fight, and shouted for the battle.

09:017:021 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array,
           army against army.

09:017:022 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
           carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his
           brethren.

09:017:023 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the
           champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the
           armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same
           words: and David heard them.

09:017:024 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from
           him, and were sore afraid.

09:017:025 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
           up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that
           the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great
           riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's
           house free in Israel.

09:017:026 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What
           shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and
           taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this
           uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of
           the living God?

09:017:027 And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So
           shall it be done to the man that killeth him.

09:017:028 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
           and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why
           camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those
           few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the
           naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou
           mightest see the battle.

09:017:029 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

09:017:030 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the
           same manner: and the people answered him again after the
           former manner.

09:017:031 And when the words were heard which David spake, they
           rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.

09:017:032 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of
           him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

09:017:033 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
           Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he
           a man of war from his youth.

09:017:034 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep,
           and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the
           flock:

09:017:035 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out
           of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by
           his beard, and smote him, and slew him.

09:017:036 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
           uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he
           hath defied the armies of the living God.

09:017:037 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
           of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver
           me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto
           David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.

09:017:038 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of
           brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

09:017:039 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to
           go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I
           cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David
           put them off him.

09:017:040 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
           stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag
           which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand:
           and he drew near to the Philistine.

09:017:041 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the
           man that bare the shield went before him.

09:017:042 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
           disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a
           fair countenance.

09:017:043 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou
           comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by
           his gods.

09:017:044 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
           thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the
           field.

09:017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
           sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee
           in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of
           Israel, whom thou hast defied.

09:017:046 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
           smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the
           carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the
           fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that
           all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

09:017:047 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
           sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will
           give you into our hands.

09:017:048 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
           drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward
           the army to meet the Philistine.

09:017:049 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,
           and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that
           the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to
           the earth.

09:017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
           stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was
           no sword in the hand of David.

09:017:051 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took
           his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew
           him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines
           saw their champion was dead, they fled.

09:017:052 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
           pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to
           the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell
           down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

09:017:053 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
           Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

09:017:054 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
           Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

09:017:055 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he
           said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is
           this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I
           cannot tell.

09:017:056 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

09:017:057 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
           Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of
           the Philistine in his hand.

09:017:058 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
           David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the
           Bethlehemite.

09:018:001 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
           Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of
           David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

09:018:002 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
           to his father's house.

09:018:003 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
           as his own soul.

09:018:004 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him,
           and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and
           to his bow, and to his girdle.

09:018:005 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
           himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he
           was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the
           sight of Saul's servants.

09:018:006 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
           the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of
           all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,
           with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.

09:018:007 And the women answered one another as they played, and said,
           Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.

09:018:008 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
           said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me
           they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more
           but the kingdom?

09:018:009 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

09:018:010 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from
           God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the
           house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and
           there was a javelin in Saul's hand.

09:018:011 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David
           even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his
           presence twice.

09:018:012 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him,
           and was departed from Saul.

09:018:013 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
           over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the
           people.

09:018:014 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
           was with him.

09:018:015 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely,
           he was afraid of him.

09:018:016 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and
           came in before them.

09:018:017 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her
           will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and
           fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be
           upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.

09:018:018 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
           father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the
           king?

09:018:019 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter
           should have been given to David, that she was given unto
           Adriel the Meholathite to wife.

09:018:020 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul,
           and the thing pleased him.

09:018:021 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
           him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
           Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in
           law in the one of the twain.

09:018:022 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
           secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and
           all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in
           law.

09:018:023 And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David.
           And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's
           son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?

09:018:024 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner
           spake David.

09:018:025 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth
           not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to
           be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make
           David fall by the hand of the Philistines.

09:018:026 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
           well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not
           expired.

09:018:027 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of
           the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their
           foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that
           he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal
           his daughter to wife.

09:018:028 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
           Michal Saul's daughter loved him.

09:018:029 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
           David's enemy continually.

09:018:030 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to
           pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more
           wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was
           much set by.

09:019:001 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
           that they should kill David.

09:019:002 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
           told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now
           therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the
           morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:

09:019:003 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
           where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and
           what I see, that I will tell thee.

09:019:004 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and
           said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant,
           against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and
           because his works have been to thee-ward very good:

09:019:005 For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine,
           and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou
           sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin
           against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

09:019:006 And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware,
           As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

09:019:007 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
           things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his
           presence, as in times past.

09:019:008 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with
           the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and
           they fled from him.

09:019:009 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in
           his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with
           his hand.

09:019:010 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
           javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he
           smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped
           that night.

09:019:011 Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him,
           and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told
           him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow
           thou shalt be slain.

09:019:012 So Michal let David down through a window: and he went, and
           fled, and escaped.

09:019:013 And Michal took an image, and laid it in the bed, and put a
           pillow of goats' hair for his bolster, and covered it with a
           cloth.

09:019:014 And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is
           sick.

09:019:015 And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring
           him up to me in the bed, that I may slay him.

09:019:016 And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an
           image in the bed, with a pillow of goats' hair for his
           bolster.

09:019:017 And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so, and
           sent away mine enemy, that he is escaped? And Michal answered
           Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; why should I kill thee?

09:019:018 So David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and
           told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went
           and dwelt in Naioth.

09:019:019 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in
           Ramah.

09:019:020 And Saul sent messengers to take David: and when they saw the
           company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as
           appointed over them, the Spirit of God was upon the messengers
           of Saul, and they also prophesied.

09:019:021 And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they
           prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third
           time, and they prophesied also.

09:019:022 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to a great well that is
           in Sechu: and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David?
           And one said, Behold, they be at Naioth in Ramah.

09:019:023 And he went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God
           was upon him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he
           came to Naioth in Ramah.

09:019:024 And he stripped off his clothes also, and prophesied before
           Samuel in like manner, and lay down naked all that day and all
           that night. Wherefore they say, Is Saul also among the
           prophets?

09:020:001 And David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before
           Jonathan, What have I done? what is mine iniquity? and what is
           my sin before thy father, that he seeketh my life?

09:020:002 And he said unto him, God forbid; thou shalt not die: behold,
           my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he
           will shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from
           me? it is not so.

09:020:003 And David sware moreover, and said, Thy father certainly
           knoweth that I have found grace in thine eyes; and he saith,
           Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved: but truly as
           the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, there is but a step
           between me and death.

09:020:004 Then said Jonathan unto David, Whatsoever thy soul desireth, I
           will even do it for thee.

09:020:005 And David said unto Jonathan, Behold, to morrow is the new
           moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at meat: but
           let me go, that I may hide myself in the field unto the third
           day at even.

09:020:006 If thy father at all miss me, then say, David earnestly asked
           leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city: for there
           is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.

09:020:007 If he say thus, It is well; thy servant shall have peace: but
           if he be very wroth, then be sure that evil is determined by
           him.

09:020:008 Therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant; for thou
           hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the LORD with
           thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquity, slay me
           thyself; for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?

09:020:009 And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee: for if I knew
           certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon
           thee, then would not I tell it thee?

09:020:010 Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? or what if thy
           father answer thee roughly?

09:020:011 And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the
           field. And they went out both of them into the field.

09:020:012 And Jonathan said unto David, O LORD God of Israel, when I
           have sounded my father about to morrow any time, or the third
           day, and, behold, if there be good toward David, and I then
           send not unto thee, and shew it thee;

09:020:013 The LORD do so and much more to Jonathan: but if it please my
           father to do thee evil, then I will shew it thee, and send
           thee away, that thou mayest go in peace: and the LORD be with
           thee, as he hath been with my father.

09:020:014 And thou shalt not only while yet I live shew me the kindness
           of the LORD, that I die not:

09:020:015 But also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for
           ever: no, not when the LORD hath cut off the enemies of David
           every one from the face of the earth.

09:020:016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, saying,
           Let the LORD even require it at the hand of David's enemies.

09:020:017 And Jonathan caused David to swear again, because he loved
           him: for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

09:020:018 Then Jonathan said to David, To morrow is the new moon: and
           thou shalt be missed, because thy seat will be empty.

09:020:019 And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down
           quickly, and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself
           when the business was in hand, and shalt remain by the stone
           Ezel.

09:020:020 And I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof, as though I
           shot at a mark.

09:020:021 And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find out the
           arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows
           are on this side of thee, take them; then come thou: for there
           is peace to thee, and no hurt; as the LORD liveth.

09:020:022 But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are
           beyond thee; go thy way: for the LORD hath sent thee away.

09:020:023 And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of,
           behold, the LORD be between thee and me for ever.

09:020:024 So David hid himself in the field: and when the new moon was
           come, the king sat him down to eat meat.

09:020:025 And the king sat upon his seat, as at other times, even upon a
           seat by the wall: and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul's
           side, and David's place was empty.

09:020:026 Nevertheless Saul spake not any thing that day: for he
           thought, Something hath befallen him, he is not clean; surely
           he is not clean.

09:020:027 And it came to pass on the morrow, which was the second day of
           the month, that David's place was empty: and Saul said unto
           Jonathan his son, Wherefore cometh not the son of Jesse to
           meat, neither yesterday, nor to day?

09:020:028 And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me
           to go to Bethlehem:

09:020:029 And he said, Let me go, I pray thee; for our family hath a
           sacrifice in the city; and my brother, he hath commanded me to
           be there: and now, if I have found favour in thine eyes, let
           me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he
           cometh not unto the king's table.

09:020:030 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said
           unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I
           know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own
           confusion, and unto the confusion of thy mother's nakedness?

09:020:031 For as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground, thou
           shalt not be established, nor thy kingdom. Wherefore now send
           and fetch him unto me, for he shall surely die.

09:020:032 And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said unto him,
           Wherefore shall he be slain? what hath he done?

09:020:033 And Saul cast a javelin at him to smite him: whereby Jonathan
           knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.

09:020:034 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eat
           no meat the second day of the month: for he was grieved for
           David, because his father had done him shame.

09:020:035 And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out
           into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little
           lad with him.

09:020:036 And he said unto his lad, Run, find out now the arrows which I
           shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

09:020:037 And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which
           Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is
           not the arrow beyond thee?

09:020:038 And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not.
           And Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his
           master.

09:020:039 But the lad knew not any thing: only Jonathan and David knew
           the matter.

09:020:040 And Jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad, and said unto
           him, Go, carry them to the city.

09:020:041 And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place
           toward the south, and fell on his face to the ground, and
           bowed himself three times: and they kissed one another, and
           wept one with another, until David exceeded.

09:020:042 And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have
           sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, The LORD be
           between me and thee, and between my seed and thy seed for
           ever. And he arose and departed: and Jonathan went into the
           city.

09:021:001 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest: and Ahimelech
           was afraid at the meeting of David, and said unto him, Why art
           thou alone, and no man with thee?

09:021:002 And David said unto Ahimelech the priest, The king hath
           commanded me a business, and hath said unto me, Let no man
           know any thing of the business whereabout I send thee, and
           what I have commanded thee: and I have appointed my servants
           to such and such a place.

09:021:003 Now therefore what is under thine hand? give me five loaves of
           bread in mine hand, or what there is present.

09:021:004 And the priest answered David, and said, There is no common
           bread under mine hand, but there is hallowed bread; if the
           young men have kept themselves at least from women.

09:021:005 And David answered the priest, and said unto him, Of a truth
           women have been kept from us about these three days, since I
           came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the
           bread is in a manner common, yea, though it were sanctified
           this day in the vessel.

09:021:006 So the priest gave him hallowed bread: for there was no bread
           there but the shewbread, that was taken from before the LORD,
           to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

09:021:007 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,
           detained before the LORD; and his name was Doeg, an Edomite,
           the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to Saul.

09:021:008 And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under
           thine hand spear or sword? for I have neither brought my sword
           nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required
           haste.

09:021:009 And the priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom
           thou slewest in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped
           in a cloth behind the ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it:
           for there is no other save that here. And David said, There is
           none like that; give it me.

09:021:010 And David arose and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went
           to Achish the king of Gath.

09:021:011 And the servants of Achish said unto him, Is not this David
           the king of the land? did they not sing one to another of him
           in dances, saying, Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
           his ten thousands?

09:021:012 And David laid up these words in his heart, and was sore
           afraid of Achish the king of Gath.

09:021:013 And he changed his behaviour before them, and feigned himself
           mad in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,
           and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.

09:021:014 Then said Achish unto his servants, Lo, ye see the man is mad:
           wherefore then have ye brought him to me?

09:021:015 Have I need of mad men, that ye have brought this fellow to
           play the mad man in my presence? shall this fellow come into
           my house?

09:022:001 David therefore departed thence, and escaped to the cave
           Adullam: and when his brethren and all his father's house
           heard it, they went down thither to him.

09:022:002 And every one that was in distress, and every one that was in
           debt, and every one that was discontented, gathered themselves
           unto him; and he became a captain over them: and there were
           with him about four hundred men.

09:022:003 And David went thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he said unto the
           king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come
           forth, and be with you, till I know what God will do for me.

09:022:004 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt
           with him all the while that David was in the hold.

09:022:005 And the prophet Gad said unto David, Abide not in the hold;
           depart, and get thee into the land of Judah. Then David
           departed, and came into the forest of Hareth.

09:022:006 When Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that
           were with him, (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in
           Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his servants were
           standing about him;)

09:022:007 Then Saul said unto his servants that stood about him, Hear
           now, ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of
           you fields and vineyards, and make you all captains of
           thousands, and captains of hundreds;

09:022:008 That all of you have conspired against me, and there is none
           that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of
           Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me, or
           sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against
           me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

09:022:009 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, which was set over the
           servants of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to
           Nob, to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

09:022:010 And he enquired of the LORD for him, and gave him victuals,
           and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

09:022:011 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of
           Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests that were in
           Nob: and they came all of them to the king.

09:022:012 And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered,
           Here I am, my lord.

09:022:013 And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou
           and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread, and a
           sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise
           against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

09:022:014 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who is so
           faithful among all thy servants as David, which is the king's
           son in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in
           thine house?

09:022:015 Did I then begin to enquire of God for him? be it far from me:
           let not the king impute any thing unto his servant, nor to all
           the house of my father: for thy servant knew nothing of all
           this, less or more.

09:022:016 And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and
           all thy father's house.

09:022:017 And the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn,
           and slay the priests of the LORD: because their hand also is
           with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not
           shew it to me. But the servants of the king would not put
           forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the LORD.

09:022:018 And the king said to Doeg, Turn thou, and fall upon the
           priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell upon the
           priests, and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that
           did wear a linen ephod.

09:022:019 And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of
           the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and
           oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

09:022:020 And one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named
           Abiathar, escaped, and fled after David.

09:022:021 And Abiathar shewed David that Saul had slain the LORD's
           priests.

09:022:022 And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day, when Doeg
           the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul: I have
           occasioned the death of all the persons of thy father's house.

09:022:023 Abide thou with me, fear not: for he that seeketh my life
           seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt be in safeguard.

09:023:001 Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight
           against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.

09:023:002 Therefore David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go and
           smite these Philistines? And the LORD said unto David, Go, and
           smite the Philistines, and save Keilah.

09:023:003 And David's men said unto him, Behold, we be afraid here in
           Judah: how much more then if we come to Keilah against the
           armies of the Philistines?

09:023:004 Then David enquired of the LORD yet again. And the LORD
           answered him and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will
           deliver the Philistines into thine hand.

09:023:005 So David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the
           Philistines, and brought away their cattle, and smote them
           with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of
           Keilah.

09:023:006 And it came to pass, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled
           to David to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his
           hand.

09:023:007 And it was told Saul that David was come to Keilah. And Saul
           said, God hath delivered him into mine hand; for he is shut
           in, by entering into a town that hath gates and bars.

09:023:008 And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to
           Keilah, to besiege David and his men.

09:023:009 And David knew that Saul secretly practised mischief against
           him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring hither the
           ephod.

09:023:010 Then said David, O LORD God of Israel, thy servant hath
           certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to
           destroy the city for my sake.

09:023:011 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? will Saul
           come down, as thy servant hath heard? O LORD God of Israel, I
           beseech thee, tell thy servant. And the LORD said, He will
           come down.

09:023:012 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men
           into the hand of Saul? And the LORD said, They will deliver
           thee up.

09:023:013 Then David and his men, which were about six hundred, arose
           and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoever they could
           go. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah;
           and he forbare to go forth.

09:023:014 And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds, and
           remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul
           sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.

09:023:015 And David saw that Saul was come out to seek his life: and
           David was in the wilderness of Ziph in a wood.

09:023:016 And Jonathan Saul's son arose, and went to David into the
           wood, and strengthened his hand in God.

09:023:017 And he said unto him, Fear not: for the hand of Saul my father
           shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I
           shall be next unto thee; and that also Saul my father knoweth.

09:023:018 And they two made a covenant before the LORD: and David abode
           in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

09:023:019 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
           David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the
           hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?

09:023:020 Now therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire
           of thy soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver him
           into the king's hand.

09:023:021 And Saul said, Blessed be ye of the LORD; for ye have
           compassion on me.

09:023:022 Go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where
           his haunt is, and who hath seen him there: for it is told me
           that he dealeth very subtilly.

09:023:023 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places
           where he hideth himself, and come ye again to me with the
           certainty, and I will go with you: and it shall come to pass,
           if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout
           all the thousands of Judah.

09:023:024 And they arose, and went to Ziph before Saul: but David and
           his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the plain on the
           south of Jeshimon.

09:023:025 Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David;
           wherefore he came down into a rock, and abode in the
           wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after
           David in the wilderness of Maon.

09:023:026 And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his
           men on that side of the mountain: and David made haste to get
           away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David
           and his men round about to take them.

09:023:027 But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and
           come; for the Philistines have invaded the land.

09:023:028 Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went
           against the Philistines: therefore they called that place
           Selahammahlekoth.

09:023:029 And David went up from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at
           Engedi.

09:024:001 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from following the
           Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in
           the wilderness of Engedi.

09:024:002 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,
           and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild
           goats.

09:024:003 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave;
           and Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men
           remained in the sides of the cave.

09:024:004 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which
           the LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy
           into thine hand, that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem
           good unto thee. Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of
           Saul's robe privily.

09:024:005 And it came to pass afterward, that David's heart smote him,
           because he had cut off Saul's skirt.

09:024:006 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do
           this thing unto my master, the LORD's anointed, to stretch
           forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of the
           LORD.

09:024:007 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered
           them not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the
           cave, and went on his way.

09:024:008 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and
           cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul
           looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth,
           and bowed himself.

09:024:009 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men's words,
           saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?

09:024:010 Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had
           delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some
           bade me kill thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I
           will not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the
           LORD's anointed.

09:024:011 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
           hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed
           thee not, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor
           transgression in mine hand, and I have not sinned against
           thee; yet thou huntest my soul to take it.

09:024:012 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
           thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

09:024:013 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth
           from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.

09:024:014 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost
           thou pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

09:024:015 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee,
           and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.

09:024:016 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
           these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my
           son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

09:024:017 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
           hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.

09:024:018 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well
           with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into
           thine hand, thou killedst me not.

09:024:019 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
           wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done
           unto me this day.

09:024:020 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king,
           and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine
           hand.

09:024:021 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not
           cut off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my
           name out of my father's house.

09:024:022 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and
           his men gat them up unto the hold.

09:025:001 And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered
           together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at
           Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of
           Paran.

09:025:002 And there was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;
           and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep,
           and a thousand goats: and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

09:025:003 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife
           Abigail: and she was a woman of good understanding, and of a
           beautiful countenance: but the man was churlish and evil in
           his doings; and he was of the house of Caleb.

09:025:004 And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal did shear his
           sheep.

09:025:005 And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the
           young men, Get you up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet
           him in my name:

09:025:006 And thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity, Peace
           be both to thee, and peace be to thine house, and peace be
           unto all that thou hast.

09:025:007 And now I have heard that thou hast shearers: now thy
           shepherds which were with us, we hurt them not, neither was
           there ought missing unto them, all the while they were in
           Carmel.

09:025:008 Ask thy young men, and they will shew thee. Wherefore let the
           young men find favour in thine eyes: for we come in a good
           day: give, I pray thee, whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto
           thy servants, and to thy son David.

09:025:009 And when David's young men came, they spake to Nabal according
           to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.

09:025:010 And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?
           and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days
           that break away every man from his master.

09:025:011 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my flesh that I
           have killed for my shearers, and give it unto men, whom I know
           not whence they be?

09:025:012 So David's young men turned their way, and went again, and
           came and told him all those sayings.

09:025:013 And David said unto his men, Gird ye on every man his sword.
           And they girded on every man his sword; and David also girded
           on his sword: and there went up after David about four hundred
           men; and two hundred abode by the stuff.

09:025:014 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying,
           Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute
           our master; and he railed on them.

09:025:015 But the men were very good unto us, and we were not hurt,
           neither missed we any thing, as long as we were conversant
           with them, when we were in the fields:

09:025:016 They were a wall unto us both by night and day, all the while
           we were with them keeping the sheep.

09:025:017 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do; for evil is
           determined against our master, and against all his household:
           for he is such a son of Belial, that a man cannot speak to
           him.

09:025:018 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two
           bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five
           measures of parched corn, and an hundred clusters of raisins,
           and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.

09:025:019 And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I
           come after you. But she told not her husband Nabal.

09:025:020 And it was so, as she rode on the ass, that she came down by
           the covert on the hill, and, behold, David and his men came
           down against her; and she met them.

09:025:021 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this
           fellow hath in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of
           all that pertained unto him: and he hath requited me evil for
           good.

09:025:022 So and more also do God unto the enemies of David, if I leave
           of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that
           pisseth against the wall.

09:025:023 And when Abigail saw David, she hasted, and lighted off the
           ass, and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself to
           the ground,

09:025:024 And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let
           this iniquity be: and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
           in thine audience, and hear the words of thine handmaid.

09:025:025 Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, even
           Nabal: for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and
           folly is with him: but I thine handmaid saw not the young men
           of my lord, whom thou didst send.

09:025:026 Now therefore, my lord, as the LORD liveth, and as thy soul
           liveth, seeing the LORD hath withholden thee from coming to
           shed blood, and from avenging thyself with thine own hand, now
           let thine enemies, and they that seek evil to my lord, be as
           Nabal.

09:025:027 And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto
           my lord, let it even be given unto the young men that follow
           my lord.

09:025:028 I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thine handmaid: for the
           LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house; because my lord
           fighteth the battles of the LORD, and evil hath not been found
           in thee all thy days.

09:025:029 Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seek thy soul: but
           the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with
           the LORD thy God; and the souls of thine enemies, them shall
           he sling out, as out of the middle of a sling.

09:025:030 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD shall have done to my
           lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning
           thee, and shall have appointed thee ruler over Israel;

09:025:031 That this shall be no grief unto thee, nor offence of heart
           unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless, or
           that my lord hath avenged himself: but when the LORD shall
           have dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmaid.

09:025:032 And David said to Abigail, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,
           which sent thee this day to meet me:

09:025:033 And blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou, which hast
           kept me this day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging
           myself with mine own hand.

09:025:034 For in very deed, as the LORD God of Israel liveth, which hath
           kept me back from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and
           come to meet me, surely there had not been left unto Nabal by
           the morning light any that pisseth against the wall.

09:025:035 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him,
           and said unto her, Go up in peace to thine house; see, I have
           hearkened to thy voice, and have accepted thy person.

09:025:036 And Abigail came to Nabal; and, behold, he held a feast in his
           house, like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry
           within him, for he was very drunken: wherefore she told him
           nothing, less or more, until the morning light.

09:025:037 But it came to pass in the morning, when the wine was gone out
           of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his
           heart died within him, and he became as a stone.

09:025:038 And it came to pass about ten days after, that the LORD smote
           Nabal, that he died.

09:025:039 And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be
           the LORD, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the
           hand of Nabal, and hath kept his servant from evil: for the
           LORD hath returned the wickedness of Nabal upon his own head.
           And David sent and communed with Abigail, to take her to him
           to wife.

09:025:040 And when the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,
           they spake unto her, saying, David sent us unto thee, to take
           thee to him to wife.

09:025:041 And she arose, and bowed herself on her face to the earth, and
           said, Behold, let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet
           of the servants of my lord.

09:025:042 And Abigail hasted, and arose and rode upon an ass, with five
           damsels of hers that went after her; and she went after the
           messengers of David, and became his wife.

09:025:043 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they were also both of
           them his wives.

09:025:044 But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to
           Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.

09:026:001 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not
           David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
           Jeshimon?

09:026:002 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
           having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek
           David in the wilderness of Ziph.

09:026:003 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
           Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and
           he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

09:026:004 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
           come in very deed.

09:026:005 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
           and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son
           of Ner, the captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench,
           and the people pitched round about him.

09:026:006 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
           Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will
           go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will
           go down with thee.

09:026:007 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
           Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in
           the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round
           about him.

09:026:008 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy
           into thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I
           pray thee, with the spear even to the earth at once, and I
           will not smite him the second time.

09:026:009 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can
           stretch forth his hand against the LORD's anointed, and be
           guiltless?

09:026:010 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall
           smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend
           into battle, and perish.

09:026:011 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
           the LORD's anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear
           that is at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.

09:026:012 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul's
           bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew
           it, neither awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep
           sleep from the LORD was fallen upon them.

09:026:013 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top
           of an hill afar off; a great space being between them:

09:026:014 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
           saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and
           said, Who art thou that criest to the king?

09:026:015 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who
           is like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept
           thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in to
           destroy the king thy lord.

09:026:016 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD
           liveth, ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your
           master, the LORD's anointed. And now see where the king's
           spear is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.

09:026:017 And Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my
           son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

09:026:018 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
           servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?

09:026:019 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the
           words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against
           me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of
           men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me
           out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD,
           saying, Go, serve other gods.

09:026:020 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
           face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a
           flea, as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.

09:026:021 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I
           will no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in
           thine eyes this day: behold, I have played the fool, and have
           erred exceedingly.

09:026:022 And David answered and said, Behold the king's spear! and let
           one of the young men come over and fetch it.

09:026:023 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
           faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day,
           but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD's
           anointed.

09:026:024 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine
           eyes, so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD,
           and let him deliver me out of all tribulation.

09:026:025 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou
           shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So
           David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.

09:027:001 And David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the
           hand of Saul: there is nothing better for me than that I
           should speedily escape into the land of the Philistines; and
           Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more in any coast of
           Israel: so shall I escape out of his hand.

09:027:002 And David arose, and he passed over with the six hundred men
           that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of
           Gath.

09:027:003 And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man
           with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam the
           Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

09:027:004 And it was told Saul that David was fled to Gath: and he
           sought no more again for him.

09:027:005 And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine
           eyes, let them give me a place in some town in the country,
           that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in
           the royal city with thee?

09:027:006 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day: wherefore Ziklag
           pertaineth unto the kings of Judah unto this day.

09:027:007 And the time that David dwelt in the country of the
           Philistines was a full year and four months.

09:027:008 And David and his men went up, and invaded the Geshurites, and
           the Gezrites, and the Amalekites: for those nations were of
           old the inhabitants of the land, as thou goest to Shur, even
           unto the land of Egypt.

09:027:009 And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman
           alive, and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the asses,
           and the camels, and the apparel, and returned, and came to
           Achish.

09:027:010 And Achish said, Whither have ye made a road to day? And David
           said, Against the south of Judah, and against the south of the
           Jerahmeelites, and against the south of the Kenites.

09:027:011 And David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings
           to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did
           David, and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in
           the country of the Philistines.

09:027:012 And Achish believed David, saying, He hath made his people
           Israel utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant
           for ever.

09:028:001 And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines
           gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with
           Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know thou assuredly, that
           thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.

09:028:002 And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy
           servant can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore will I
           make thee keeper of mine head for ever.

09:028:003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and
           buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. And Saul had put
           away those that had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of
           the land.

09:028:004 And the Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and
           pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and
           they pitched in Gilboa.

09:028:005 And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid,
           and his heart greatly trembled.

09:028:006 And when Saul enquired of the LORD, the LORD answered him not,
           neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

09:028:007 Then said Saul unto his servants, Seek me a woman that hath a
           familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and enquire of her. And
           his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman that hath a
           familiar spirit at Endor.

09:028:008 And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he
           went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by
           night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the
           familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto
           thee.

09:028:009 And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul
           hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar
           spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then
           layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?

09:028:010 And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth,
           there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.

09:028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he
           said, Bring me up Samuel.

09:028:012 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice:
           and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived
           me? for thou art Saul.

09:028:013 And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest
           thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out
           of the earth.

09:028:014 And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old
           man cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul
           perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to
           the ground, and bowed himself.

09:028:015 And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring
           me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the
           Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me,
           and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
           therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto
           me what I shall do.

09:028:016 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing
           the LORD is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?

09:028:017 And the LORD hath done to him, as he spake by me: for the LORD
           hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given it to thy
           neighbour, even to David:

09:028:018 Because thou obeyedst not the voice of the LORD, nor
           executedst his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the
           LORD done this thing unto thee this day.

09:028:019 Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the
           hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons
           be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel
           into the hand of the Philistines.

09:028:020 Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was
           sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no
           strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor
           all the night.

09:028:021 And the woman came unto Saul, and saw that he was sore
           troubled, and said unto him, Behold, thine handmaid hath
           obeyed thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have
           hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me.

09:028:022 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice
           of thine handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before
           thee; and eat, that thou mayest have strength, when thou goest
           on thy way.

09:028:023 But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants,
           together with the woman, compelled him; and he hearkened unto
           their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.

09:028:024 And the woman had a fat calf in the house; and she hasted, and
           killed it, and took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake
           unleavened bread thereof:

09:028:025 And she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and
           they did eat. Then they rose up, and went away that night.

09:029:001 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to
           Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountain which is in
           Jezreel.

09:029:002 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by
           thousands: but David and his men passed on in the rereward
           with Achish.

09:029:003 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What do these
           Hebrews here? And Achish said unto the princes of the
           Philistines, Is not this David, the servant of Saul the king
           of Israel, which hath been with me these days, or these years,
           and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto
           this day?

09:029:004 And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him; and
           the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow
           return, that he may go again to his place which thou hast
           appointed him, and let him not go down with us to battle, lest
           in the battle he be an adversary to us: for wherewith should
           he reconcile himself unto his master? should it not be with
           the heads of these men?

09:029:005 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,
           saying, Saul slew his thousands, and David his ten thousands?

09:029:006 Then Achish called David, and said unto him, Surely, as the
           LORD liveth, thou hast been upright, and thy going out and thy
           coming in with me in the host is good in my sight: for I have
           not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me
           unto this day: nevertheless the lords favour thee not.

09:029:007 Wherefore now return, and go in peace, that thou displease not
           the lords of the Philistines.

09:029:008 And David said unto Achish, But what have I done? and what
           hast thou found in thy servant so long as I have been with
           thee unto this day, that I may not go fight against the
           enemies of my lord the king?

09:029:009 And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art
           good in my sight, as an angel of God: notwithstanding the
           princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with
           us to the battle.

09:029:010 Wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy master's
           servants that are come with thee: and as soon as ye be up
           early in the morning, and have light, depart.

09:029:011 So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning,
           to return into the land of the Philistines. And the
           Philistines went up to Jezreel.

09:030:001 And it came to pass, when David and his men were come to
           Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had invaded the
           south, and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burned it with
           fire;

09:030:002 And had taken the women captives, that were therein: they slew
           not any, either great or small, but carried them away, and
           went on their way.

09:030:003 So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was
           burned with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their
           daughters, were taken captives.

09:030:004 Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their
           voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

09:030:005 And David's two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the
           Jezreelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

09:030:006 And David was greatly distressed; for the people spake of
           stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved,
           every man for his sons and for his daughters: but David
           encouraged himself in the LORD his God.

09:030:007 And David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech's son, I pray
           thee, bring me hither the ephod. And Abiathar brought thither
           the ephod to David.

09:030:008 And David enquired at the LORD, saying, Shall I pursue after
           this troop? shall I overtake them? And he answered him,
           Pursue: for thou shalt surely overtake them, and without fail
           recover all.

09:030:009 So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him,
           and came to the brook Besor, where those that were left behind
           stayed.

09:030:010 But David pursued, he and four hundred men: for two hundred
           abode behind, which were so faint that they could not go over
           the brook Besor.

09:030:011 And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to
           David, and gave him bread, and he did eat; and they made him
           drink water;

09:030:012 And they gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters
           of raisins: and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to
           him: for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three
           days and three nights.

09:030:013 And David said unto him, To whom belongest thou? and whence
           art thou? And he said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to
           an Amalekite; and my master left me, because three days agone
           I fell sick.

09:030:014 We made an invasion upon the south of the Cherethites, and
           upon the coast which belongeth to Judah, and upon the south of
           Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.

09:030:015 And David said to him, Canst thou bring me down to this
           company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt
           neither kill me, nor deliver me into the hands of my master,
           and I will bring thee down to this company.

09:030:016 And when he had brought him down, behold, they were spread
           abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dancing,
           because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the
           land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

09:030:017 And David smote them from the twilight even unto the evening
           of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, save
           four hundred young men, which rode upon camels, and fled.

09:030:018 And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away:
           and David rescued his two wives.

09:030:019 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor
           great, neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor any
           thing that they had taken to them: David recovered all.

09:030:020 And David took all the flocks and the herds, which they drave
           before those other cattle, and said, This is David's spoil.

09:030:021 And David came to the two hundred men, which were so faint
           that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to
           abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet David,
           and to meet the people that were with him: and when David came
           near to the people, he saluted them.

09:030:022 Then answered all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those
           that went with David, and said, Because they went not with us,
           we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have
           recovered, save to every man his wife and his children, that
           they may lead them away, and depart.

09:030:023 Then said David, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that
           which the LORD hath given us, who hath preserved us, and
           delivered the company that came against us into our hand.

09:030:024 For who will hearken unto you in this matter? but as his part
           is that goeth down to the battle, so shall his part be that
           tarrieth by the stuff: they shall part alike.

09:030:025 And it was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute
           and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.

09:030:026 And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the
           elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present
           for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;

09:030:027 To them which were in Bethel, and to them which were in south
           Ramoth, and to them which were in Jattir,

09:030:028 And to them which were in Aroer, and to them which were in
           Siphmoth, and to them which were in Eshtemoa,

09:030:029 And to them which were in Rachal, and to them which were in
           the cities of the Jerahmeelites, and to them which were in the
           cities of the Kenites,

09:030:030 And to them which were in Hormah, and to them which were in
           Chorashan, and to them which were in Athach,

09:030:031 And to them which were in Hebron, and to all the places where
           David himself and his men were wont to haunt.

09:031:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of
           Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
           in mount Gilboa.

09:031:002 And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons;
           and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
           Melchishua, Saul's sons.

09:031:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
           him; and he was sore wounded of the archers.

09:031:004 Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and
           thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and
           thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armourbearer would
           not; for he was sore afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and
           fell upon it.

09:031:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
           likewise upon his sword, and died with him.

09:031:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armourbearer, and
           all his men, that same day together.

09:031:007 And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the
           valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that
           the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,
           they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came
           and dwelt in them.

09:031:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
           to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons
           fallen in mount Gilboa.

09:031:009 And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armour, and
           sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to publish
           it in the house of their idols, and among the people.

09:031:010 And they put his armour in the house of Ashtaroth: and they
           fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.

09:031:011 And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which
           the Philistines had done to Saul;

09:031:012 All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the
           body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of
           Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.

09:031:013 And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at
           Jabesh, and fasted seven days.

Book 10        2 Samuel

10:001:001 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was
           returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
           abode two days in Ziklag;

10:001:002 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man
           came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and
           earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David,
           that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

10:001:003 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
           unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

10:001:004 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee,
           tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the
           battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and
           Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

10:001:005 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest
           thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

10:001:006 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
           upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and,
           lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

10:001:007 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.
           And I answered, Here am I.

10:001:008 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
           Amalekite.

10:001:009 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay
           me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole
           in me.

10:001:010 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
           could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown
           that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm,
           and have brought them hither unto my lord.

10:001:011 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and
           likewise all the men that were with him:

10:001:012 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul,
           and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and
           for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the
           sword.

10:001:013 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art
           thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an
           Amalekite.

10:001:014 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
           forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?

10:001:015 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and
           fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.

10:001:016 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
           mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the
           LORD's anointed.

10:001:017 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
           Jonathan his son:

10:001:018 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the
           bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)

10:001:019 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are
           the mighty fallen!

10:001:020 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;
           lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the
           daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

10:001:021 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there
           be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the
           shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul,
           as though he had not been anointed with oil.

10:001:022 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the
           bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul
           returned not empty.

10:001:023 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and
           in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than
           eagles, they were stronger than lions.

10:001:024 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
           scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold
           upon your apparel.

10:001:025 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O
           Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.

10:001:026 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant
           hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing
           the love of women.

10:001:027 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!

10:002:001 And it came to pass after this, that David enquired of the
           LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?
           And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And David said, Whither
           shall I go up? And he said, Unto Hebron.

10:002:002 So David went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the
           Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite.

10:002:003 And his men that were with him did David bring up, every man
           with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.

10:002:004 And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king
           over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, That the
           men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul.

10:002:005 And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and
           said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed
           this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul, and have buried
           him.

10:002:006 And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also
           will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this
           thing.

10:002:007 Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye
           valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of
           Judah have anointed me king over them.

10:002:008 But Abner the son of Ner, captain of Saul's host, took
           Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim;

10:002:009 And made him king over Gilead, and over the Ashurites, and
           over Jezreel, and over Ephraim, and over Benjamin, and over
           all Israel.

10:002:010 Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to
           reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of
           Judah followed David.

10:002:011 And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of
           Judah was seven years and six months.

10:002:012 And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the
           son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.

10:002:013 And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David, went
           out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat
           down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on
           the other side of the pool.

10:002:014 And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play
           before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.

10:002:015 Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin,
           which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of
           the servants of David.

10:002:016 And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust
           his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together:
           wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in
           Gibeon.

10:002:017 And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was
           beaten, and the men of Israel, before the servants of David.

10:002:018 And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai,
           and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.

10:002:019 And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to
           the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.

10:002:020 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And
           he answered, I am.

10:002:021 And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to
           thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take
           thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from
           following of him.

10:002:022 And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following
           me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then
           should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?

10:002:023 Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the
           hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that
           the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and
           died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as
           came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still.

10:002:024 Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went
           down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth
           before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.

10:002:025 And the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together
           after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an
           hill.

10:002:026 Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour
           for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the
           latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people
           return from following their brethren?

10:002:027 And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely
           then in the morning the people had gone up every one from
           following his brother.

10:002:028 So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and
           pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.

10:002:029 And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain,
           and passed over Jordan, and went through all Bithron, and they
           came to Mahanaim.

10:002:030 And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had
           gathered all the people together, there lacked of David's
           servants nineteen men and Asahel.

10:002:031 But the servants of David had smitten of Benjamin, and of
           Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died.

10:002:032 And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of
           his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went
           all night, and they came to Hebron at break of day.

10:003:001 Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house
           of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house
           of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.

10:003:002 And unto David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was
           Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;

10:003:003 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the
           Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the
           daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;

10:003:004 And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth,
           Shephatiah the son of Abital;

10:003:005 And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David's wife. These were born
           to David in Hebron.

10:003:006 And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of
           Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong
           for the house of Saul.

10:003:007 And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter
           of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Wherefore hast thou
           gone in unto my father's concubine?

10:003:008 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and
           said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do shew kindness
           this day unto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren,
           and to his friends, and have not delivered thee into the hand
           of David, that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning
           this woman?

10:003:009 So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD hath
           sworn to David, even so I do to him;

10:003:010 To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up
           the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even
           to Beersheba.

10:003:011 And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared
           him.

10:003:012 And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying,
           Whose is the land? saying also, Make thy league with me, and,
           behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel
           unto thee.

10:003:013 And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one
           thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face,
           except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou
           comest to see my face.

10:003:014 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul's son, saying,
           Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an
           hundred foreskins of the Philistines.

10:003:015 And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from
           Phaltiel the son of Laish.

10:003:016 And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to
           Bahurim. Then said Abner unto him, Go, return. And he
           returned.

10:003:017 And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying,
           Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you:

10:003:018 Now then do it: for the LORD hath spoken of David, saying, By
           the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out
           of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all
           their enemies.

10:003:019 And Abner also spake in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went
           also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed
           good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of
           Benjamin.

10:003:020 So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And
           David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.

10:003:021 And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go, and will
           gather all Israel unto my lord the king, that they may make a
           league with thee, and that thou mayest reign over all that
           thine heart desireth. And David sent Abner away; and he went
           in peace.

10:003:022 And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing
           a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was
           not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was
           gone in peace.

10:003:023 When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they
           told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and
           he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.

10:003:024 Then Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?
           behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast sent
           him away, and he is quite gone?

10:003:025 Thou knowest Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive
           thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know
           all that thou doest.

10:003:026 And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers
           after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah:
           but David knew it not.

10:003:027 And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in
           the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under
           the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his
           brother.

10:003:028 And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom
           are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner
           the son of Ner:

10:003:029 Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father's
           house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that
           hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staff,
           or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.

10:003:030 So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had
           slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.

10:003:031 And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with
           him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn
           before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.

10:003:032 And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his
           voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people
           wept.

10:003:033 And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a
           fool dieth?

10:003:034 Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put into fetters: as a
           man falleth before wicked men, so fellest thou. And all the
           people wept again over him.

10:003:035 And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while
           it was yet day, David sware, saying, So do God to me, and more
           also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.

10:003:036 And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as
           whatsoever the king did pleased all the people.

10:003:037 For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it
           was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.

10:003:038 And the king said unto his servants, Know ye not that there is
           a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?

10:003:039 And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men
           the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward
           the doer of evil according to his wickedness.

10:004:001 And when Saul's son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his
           hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.

10:004:002 And Saul's son had two men that were captains of bands: the
           name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab,
           the sons of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Benjamin:
           (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin.

10:004:003 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there
           until this day.)

10:004:004 And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet.
           He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and
           Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled:
           and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell,
           and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.

10:004:005 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah,
           went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of
           Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.

10:004:006 And they came thither into the midst of the house, as though
           they would have fetched wheat; and they smote him under the
           fifth rib: and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

10:004:007 For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his
           bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded
           him, and took his head, and gat them away through the plain
           all night.

10:004:008 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron,
           and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of
           Saul thine enemy, which sought thy life; and the LORD hath
           avenged my lord the king this day of Saul, and of his seed.

10:004:009 And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of
           Rimmon the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the LORD liveth,
           who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity,

10:004:010 When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to
           have brought good tidings, I took hold of him, and slew him in
           Ziklag, who thought that I would have given him a reward for
           his tidings:

10:004:011 How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous person
           in his own house upon his bed? shall I not therefore now
           require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the
           earth?

10:004:012 And David commanded his young men, and they slew them, and cut
           off their hands and their feet, and hanged them up over the
           pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth, and
           buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.

10:005:001 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and
           spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

10:005:002 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he
           that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said
           to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a
           captain over Israel.

10:005:003 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and
           king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD:
           and they anointed David king over Israel.

10:005:004 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned forty years.

10:005:005 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months:
           and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all
           Israel and Judah.

10:005:006 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,
           the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying,
           Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not
           come in hither: thinking, David cannot come in hither.

10:005:007 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is
           the city of David.

10:005:008 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the
           gutter, and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind
           that are hated of David's soul, he shall be chief and captain.
           Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come
           into the house.

10:005:009 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David.
           And David built round about from Millo and inward.

10:005:010 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts
           was with him.

10:005:011 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar
           trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an
           house.

10:005:012 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king
           over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his
           people Israel's sake.

10:005:013 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
           after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and
           daughters born to David.

10:005:014 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
           Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,

10:005:015 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

10:005:016 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.

10:005:017 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David
           king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David;
           and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.

10:005:018 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley
           of Rephaim.

10:005:019 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
           Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the
           LORD said unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the
           Philistines into thine hand.

10:005:020 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
           said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me,
           as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that
           place Baalperazim.

10:005:021 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
           them.

10:005:022 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves
           in the valley of Rephaim.

10:005:023 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not
           go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them
           over against the mulberry trees.

10:005:024 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the
           tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir
           thyself: for then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite
           the host of the Philistines.

10:005:025 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
           Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.

10:006:001 Again, David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel,
           thirty thousand.

10:006:002 And David arose, and went with all the people that were with
           him from Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of
           God, whose name is called by the name of the LORD of hosts
           that dwelleth between the cherubims.

10:006:003 And they set the ark of God upon a new cart, and brought it
           out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah: and Uzzah and
           Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drave the new cart.

10:006:004 And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab which was at
           Gibeah, accompanying the ark of God: and Ahio went before the
           ark.

10:006:005 And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD
           on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps,
           and on psalteries, and on timbrels, and on cornets, and on
           cymbals.

10:006:006 And when they came to Nachon's threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth
           his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen
           shook it.

10:006:007 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God
           smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of
           God.

10:006:008 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
           upon Uzzah: and he called the name of the place Perezuzzah to
           this day.

10:006:009 And David was afraid of the LORD that day, and said, How shall
           the ark of the LORD come to me?

10:006:010 So David would not remove the ark of the LORD unto him into
           the city of David: but David carried it aside into the house
           of Obededom the Gittite.

10:006:011 And the ark of the LORD continued in the house of Obededom the
           Gittite three months: and the LORD blessed Obededom, and all
           his household.

10:006:012 And it was told king David, saying, The LORD hath blessed the
           house of Obededom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because
           of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God
           from the house of Obededom into the city of David with
           gladness.

10:006:013 And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD
           had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.

10:006:014 And David danced before the LORD with all his might; and David
           was girded with a linen ephod.

10:006:015 So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the
           LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.

10:006:016 And as the ark of the LORD came into the city of David, Michal
           Saul's daughter looked through a window, and saw king David
           leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she despised him in
           her heart.

10:006:017 And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his
           place, in the midst of the tabernacle that David had pitched
           for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings
           before the LORD.

10:006:018 And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt
           offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the
           name of the LORD of hosts.

10:006:019 And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole
           multitude of Israel, as well to the women as men, to every one
           a cake of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon of
           wine. So all the people departed every one to his house.

10:006:020 Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal the
           daughter of Saul came out to meet David, and said, How
           glorious was the king of Israel to day, who uncovered himself
           to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of
           the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself!

10:006:021 And David said unto Michal, It was before the LORD, which
           chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to
           appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel:
           therefore will I play before the LORD.

10:006:022 And I will yet be more vile than thus, and will be base in
           mine own sight: and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken
           of, of them shall I be had in honour.

10:006:023 Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the
           day of her death.

10:007:001 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the
           LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;

10:007:002 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell
           in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within
           curtains.

10:007:003 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine
           heart; for the LORD is with thee.

10:007:004 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
           unto Nathan, saying,

10:007:005 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou
           build me an house for me to dwell in?

10:007:006 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I
           brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this
           day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.

10:007:007 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children
           of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel,
           whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build
           ye not me an house of cedar?

10:007:008 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
           saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from
           following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:

10:007:009 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut
           off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a
           great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in
           the earth.

10:007:010 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
           plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and
           move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict
           them any more, as beforetime,

10:007:011 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
           people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine
           enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an
           house.

10:007:012 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
           fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall
           proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.

10:007:013 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
           throne of his kingdom for ever.

10:007:014 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
           iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the
           stripes of the children of men:

10:007:015 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from
           Saul, whom I put away before thee.

10:007:016 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
           before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.

10:007:017 According to all these words, and according to all this
           vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

10:007:018 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
           Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast
           brought me hitherto?

10:007:019 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but
           thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while
           to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?

10:007:020 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,
           knowest thy servant.

10:007:021 For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast
           thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know
           them.

10:007:022 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
           thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all
           that we have heard with our ears.

10:007:023 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
           Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and
           to make him a name, and to do for you great things and
           terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou
           redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their
           gods?

10:007:024 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a
           people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their
           God.

10:007:025 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
           thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever,
           and do as thou hast said.

10:007:026 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of
           hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant
           David be established before thee.

10:007:027 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
           servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath
           thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.

10:007:028 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
           and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:

10:007:029 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy
           servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou,
           O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the
           house of thy servant be blessed for ever.

10:008:001 And after this it came to pass that David smote the
           Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out
           of the hand of the Philistines.

10:008:002 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
           down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to
           death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the
           Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.

10:008:003 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah,
           as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.

10:008:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
           horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all
           the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred
           chariots.

10:008:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer
           king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty
           thousand men.

10:008:006 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
           became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD
           preserved David whithersoever he went.

10:008:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
           of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

10:008:008 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king
           David took exceeding much brass.

10:008:009 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the
           host of Hadadezer,

10:008:010 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him,
           and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and
           smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram
           brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and
           vessels of brass:

10:008:011 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the
           silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he
           subdued;

10:008:012 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of
           the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer,
           son of Rehob, king of Zobah.

10:008:013 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
           Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.

10:008:014 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
           garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants. And
           the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.

10:008:015 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
           and justice unto all his people.

10:008:016 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
           the son of Ahilud was recorder;

10:008:017 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of
           Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;

10:008:018 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites
           and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.

10:009:001 And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of
           Saul, that I may shew him kindness for Jonathan's sake?

10:009:002 And there was of the house of Saul a servant whose name was
           Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said
           unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy servant is he.

10:009:003 And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul,
           that I may shew the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said
           unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his
           feet.

10:009:004 And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto
           the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of
           Ammiel, in Lodebar.

10:009:005 Then king David sent, and fetched him out of the house of
           Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.

10:009:006 Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul,
           was come unto David, he fell on his face, and did reverence.
           And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy
           servant!

10:009:007 And David said unto him, Fear not: for I will surely shew thee
           kindness for Jonathan thy father's sake, and will restore thee
           all the land of Saul thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at
           my table continually.

10:009:008 And he bowed himself, and said, What is thy servant, that thou
           shouldest look upon such a dead dog as I am?

10:009:009 Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said unto
           him, I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to
           Saul and to all his house.

10:009:010 Thou therefore, and thy sons, and thy servants, shall till the
           land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits, that thy
           master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth thy
           master's son shall eat bread alway at my table. Now Ziba had
           fifteen sons and twenty servants.

10:009:011 Then said Ziba unto the king, According to all that my lord
           the king hath commanded his servant, so shall thy servant do.
           As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table,
           as one of the king's sons.

10:009:012 And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And
           all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto
           Mephibosheth.

10:009:013 So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem: for he did eat continually
           at the king's table; and was lame on both his feet.

10:010:001 And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children
           of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.

10:010:002 Then said David, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
           Nahash, as his father shewed kindness unto me. And David sent
           to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father. And
           David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.

10:010:003 And the princes of the children of Ammon said unto Hanun their
           lord, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he
           hath sent comforters unto thee? hath not David rather sent his
           servants unto thee, to search the city, and to spy it out, and
           to overthrow it?

10:010:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved off the one
           half of their beards, and cut off their garments in the
           middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.

10:010:005 When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them, because
           the men were greatly ashamed: and the king said, Tarry at
           Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.

10:010:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before
           David, the children of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of
           Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen,
           and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve
           thousand men.

10:010:007 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
           the mighty men.

10:010:008 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
           array at the entering in of the gate: and the Syrians of Zoba,
           and of Rehob, and Ishtob, and Maacah, were by themselves in
           the field.

10:010:009 When Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him
           before and behind, he chose of all the choice men of Israel,
           and put them in array against the Syrians:

10:010:010 And the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of
           Abishai his brother, that he might put them in array against
           the children of Ammon.

10:010:011 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
           shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
           thee, then I will come and help thee.

10:010:012 Be of good courage, and let us play the men for our people,
           and for the cities of our God: and the LORD do that which
           seemeth him good.

10:010:013 And Joab drew nigh, and the people that were with him, unto
           the battle against the Syrians: and they fled before him.

10:010:014 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
           then fled they also before Abishai, and entered into the city.
           So Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to
           Jerusalem.

10:010:015 And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel,
           they gathered themselves together.

10:010:016 And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were
           beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the
           captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

10:010:017 And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together,
           and passed over Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Syrians set
           themselves in array against David, and fought with him.

10:010:018 And the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew the men of
           seven hundred chariots of the Syrians, and forty thousand
           horsemen, and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who
           died there.

10:010:019 And when all the kings that were servants to Hadarezer saw
           that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with
           Israel, and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the
           children of Ammon any more.

10:011:001 And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time
           when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab, and his
           servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the
           children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried
           still at Jerusalem.

10:011:002 And it came to pass in an eveningtide, that David arose from
           off his bed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house: and
           from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman
           was very beautiful to look upon.

10:011:003 And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is
           not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah
           the Hittite?

10:011:004 And David sent messengers, and took her; and she came in unto
           him, and he lay with her; for she was purified from her
           uncleanness: and she returned unto her house.

10:011:005 And the woman conceived, and sent and told David, and said, I
           am with child.

10:011:006 And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And
           Joab sent Uriah to David.

10:011:007 And when Uriah was come unto him, David demanded of him how
           Joab did, and how the people did, and how the war prospered.

10:011:008 And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house, and wash thy
           feet. And Uriah departed out of the king's house, and there
           followed him a mess of meat from the king.

10:011:009 But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the
           servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.

10:011:010 And when they had told David, saying, Uriah went not down unto
           his house, David said unto Uriah, Camest thou not from thy
           journey? why then didst thou not go down unto thine house?

10:011:011 And Uriah said unto David, The ark, and Israel, and Judah,
           abide in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord,
           are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into mine
           house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? as thou
           livest, and as thy soul liveth, I will not do this thing.

10:011:012 And David said to Uriah, Tarry here to day also, and to morrow
           I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day,
           and the morrow.

10:011:013 And when David had called him, he did eat and drink before
           him; and he made him drunk: and at even he went out to lie on
           his bed with the servants of his lord, but went not down to
           his house.

10:011:014 And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter
           to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Uriah.

10:011:015 And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set ye Uriah in the
           forefront of the hottest battle, and retire ye from him, that
           he may be smitten, and die.

10:011:016 And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he
           assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men
           were.

10:011:017 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and
           there fell some of the people of the servants of David; and
           Uriah the Hittite died also.

10:011:018 Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the
           war;

10:011:019 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an end
           of telling the matters of the war unto the king,

10:011:020 And if so be that the king's wrath arise, and he say unto
           thee, Wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye
           did fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall?

10:011:021 Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? did not a woman
           cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he
           died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? then say thou, Thy
           servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

10:011:022 So the messenger went, and came and shewed David all that Joab
           had sent him for.

10:011:023 And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed
           against us, and came out unto us into the field, and we were
           upon them even unto the entering of the gate.

10:011:024 And the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants; and
           some of the king's servants be dead, and thy servant Uriah the
           Hittite is dead also.

10:011:025 Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto
           Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword
           devoureth one as well as another: make thy battle more strong
           against the city, and overthrow it: and encourage thou him.

10:011:026 And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was
           dead, she mourned for her husband.

10:011:027 And when the mourning was past, David sent and fetched her to
           his house, and she became his wife, and bare him a son. But
           the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.

10:012:001 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came unto him, and
           said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich,
           and the other poor.

10:012:002 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:

10:012:003 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which
           he had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with
           him, and with his children; it did eat of his own meat, and
           drank of his own cup, and lay in his bosom, and was unto him
           as a daughter.

10:012:004 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
           take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the
           wayfaring man that was come unto him; but took the poor man's
           lamb, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.

10:012:005 And David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
           said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done
           this thing shall surely die:

10:012:006 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
           thing, and because he had no pity.

10:012:007 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the
           LORD God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I
           delivered thee out of the hand of Saul;

10:012:008 And I gave thee thy master's house, and thy master's wives
           into thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of
           Judah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have
           given unto thee such and such things.

10:012:009 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to
           do evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with
           the sword, and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast
           slain him with the sword of the children of Ammon.

10:012:010 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
           because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of
           Uriah the Hittite to be thy wife.

10:012:011 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
           out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine
           eyes, and give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with
           thy wives in the sight of this sun.

10:012:012 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before
           all Israel, and before the sun.

10:012:013 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD.
           And Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy
           sin; thou shalt not die.

10:012:014 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion
           to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that
           is born unto thee shall surely die.

10:012:015 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
           child that Uriah's wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.

10:012:016 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
           and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.

10:012:017 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise
           him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat
           bread with them.

10:012:018 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.
           And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child
           was dead: for they said, Behold, while the child was yet
           alive, we spake unto him, and he would not hearken unto our
           voice: how will he then vex himself, if we tell him that the
           child is dead?

10:012:019 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David
           perceived that the child was dead: therefore David said unto
           his servants, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.

10:012:020 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
           himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of
           the LORD, and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and
           when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eat.

10:012:021 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
           hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it
           was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and
           eat bread.

10:012:022 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
           for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me,
           that the child may live?

10:012:023 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him
           back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.

10:012:024 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
           and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name
           Solomon: and the LORD loved him.

10:012:025 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called
           his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.

10:012:026 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
           took the royal city.

10:012:027 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
           against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.

10:012:028 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and
           encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city,
           and it be called after my name.

10:012:029 And David gathered all the people together, and went to
           Rabbah, and fought against it, and took it.

10:012:030 And he took their king's crown from off his head, the weight
           whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it
           was set on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the
           city in great abundance.

10:012:031 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put
           them under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of
           iron, and made them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did
           he unto all the cities of the children of Ammon. So David and
           all the people returned unto Jerusalem.

10:013:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David
           had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of
           David loved her.

10:013:002 And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sick for his sister
           Tamar; for she was a virgin; and Amnon thought it hard for him
           to do anything to her.

10:013:003 But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of
           Shimeah David's brother: and Jonadab was a very subtil man.

10:013:004 And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king's son, lean
           from day to day? wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto
           him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister.

10:013:005 And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed, and make
           thyself sick: and when thy father cometh to see thee, say unto
           him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and give me meat,
           and dress the meat in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it
           at her hand.

10:013:006 So Amnon lay down, and made himself sick: and when the king
           was come to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee,
           let Tamar my sister come, and make me a couple of cakes in my
           sight, that I may eat at her hand.

10:013:007 Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother
           Amnon's house, and dress him meat.

10:013:008 So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house; and he was laid
           down. And she took flour, and kneaded it, and made cakes in
           his sight, and did bake the cakes.

10:013:009 And she took a pan, and poured them out before him; but he
           refused to eat. And Amnon said, Have out all men from me. And
           they went out every man from him.

10:013:010 And Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the meat into the chamber,
           that I may eat of thine hand. And Tamar took the cakes which
           she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her
           brother.

10:013:011 And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of
           her, and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.

10:013:012 And she answered him, Nay, my brother, do not force me; for no
           such thing ought to be done in Israel: do not thou this folly.

10:013:013 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to go? and as for thee,
           thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now therefore, I
           pray thee, speak unto the king; for he will not withhold me
           from thee.

10:013:014 Howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice: but, being
           stronger than she, forced her, and lay with her.

10:013:015 Then Amnon hated her exceedingly; so that the hatred wherewith
           he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved
           her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.

10:013:016 And she said unto him, There is no cause: this evil in sending
           me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But
           he would not hearken unto her.

10:013:017 Then he called his servant that ministered unto him, and said,
           Put now this woman out from me, and bolt the door after her.

10:013:018 And she had a garment of divers colours upon her: for with
           such robes were the king's daughters that were virgins
           apparelled. Then his servant brought her out, and bolted the
           door after her.

10:013:019 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of
           divers colours that was on her, and laid her hand on her head,
           and went on crying.

10:013:020 And Absalom her brother said unto her, Hath Amnon thy brother
           been with thee? but hold now thy peace, my sister: he is thy
           brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in
           her brother Absalom's house.

10:013:021 But when king David heard of all these things, he was very
           wroth.

10:013:022 And Absalom spake unto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad:
           for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister
           Tamar.

10:013:023 And it came to pass after two full years, that Absalom had
           sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim: and
           Absalom invited all the king's sons.

10:013:024 And Absalom came to the king, and said, Behold now, thy
           servant hath sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and
           his servants go with thy servant.

10:013:025 And the king said to Absalom, Nay, my son, let us not all now
           go, lest we be chargeable unto thee. And he pressed him:
           howbeit he would not go, but blessed him.

10:013:026 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon
           go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with
           thee?

10:013:027 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the king's
           sons go with him.

10:013:028 Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now
           when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto
           you, Smite Amnon; then kill him, fear not: have not I
           commanded you? be courageous, and be valiant.

10:013:029 And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had
           commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and every man gat
           him up upon his mule, and fled.

10:013:030 And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that tidings
           came to David, saying, Absalom hath slain all the king's sons,
           and there is not one of them left.

10:013:031 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the
           earth; and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent.

10:013:032 And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David's brother, answered and
           said, Let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the
           young men the king's sons; for Amnon only is dead: for by the
           appointment of Absalom this hath been determined from the day
           that he forced his sister Tamar.

10:013:033 Now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his
           heart, to think that all the king's sons are dead: for Amnon
           only is dead.

10:013:034 But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted
           up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came much people
           by the way of the hill side behind him.

10:013:035 And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king's sons come:
           as thy servant said, so it is.

10:013:036 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of
           speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up
           their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants
           wept very sore.

10:013:037 But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king
           of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.

10:013:038 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three
           years.

10:013:039 And the soul of king David longed to go forth unto Absalom:
           for he was comforted concerning Amnon, seeing he was dead.

10:014:001 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah perceived that the king's heart
           was toward Absalom.

10:014:002 And Joab sent to Tekoah, and fetched thence a wise woman, and
           said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner, and
           put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thyself with oil,
           but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:

10:014:003 And come to the king, and speak on this manner unto him. So
           Joab put the words in her mouth.

10:014:004 And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, she fell on
           her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, Help, O
           king.

10:014:005 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
           answered, I am indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.

10:014:006 And thy handmaid had two sons, and they two strove together in
           the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote
           the other, and slew him.

10:014:007 And, behold, the whole family is risen against thine handmaid,
           and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may
           kill him, for the life of his brother whom he slew; and we
           will destroy the heir also: and so they shall quench my coal
           which is left, and shall not leave to my husband neither name
           nor remainder upon the earth.

10:014:008 And the king said unto the woman, Go to thine house, and I
           will give charge concerning thee.

10:014:009 And the woman of Tekoah said unto the king, My lord, O king,
           the iniquity be on me, and on my father's house: and the king
           and his throne be guiltless.

10:014:010 And the king said, Whoever saith ought unto thee, bring him to
           me, and he shall not touch thee any more.

10:014:011 Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the LORD thy
           God, that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to
           destroy any more, lest they destroy my son. And he said, As
           the LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of thy son fall to
           the earth.

10:014:012 Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak
           one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.

10:014:013 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a
           thing against the people of God? for the king doth speak this
           thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doth not fetch
           home again his banished.

10:014:014 For we must needs die, and are as water spilt on the ground,
           which cannot be gathered up again; neither doth God respect
           any person: yet doth he devise means, that his banished be not
           expelled from him.

10:014:015 Now therefore that I am come to speak of this thing unto my
           lord the king, it is because the people have made me afraid:
           and thy handmaid said, I will now speak unto the king; it may
           be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid.

10:014:016 For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the
           hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out
           of the inheritance of God.

10:014:017 Then thine handmaid said, The word of my lord the king shall
           now be comfortable: for as an angel of God, so is my lord the
           king to discern good and bad: therefore the LORD thy God will
           be with thee.

10:014:018 Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from
           me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the
           woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.

10:014:019 And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all
           this? And the woman answered and said, As thy soul liveth, my
           lord the king, none can turn to the right hand or to the left
           from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy servant
           Joab, he bade me, and he put all these words in the mouth of
           thine handmaid:

10:014:020 To fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant Joab done
           this thing: and my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an
           angel of God, to know all things that are in the earth.

10:014:021 And the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this
           thing: go therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.

10:014:022 And Joab fell to the ground on his face, and bowed himself,
           and thanked the king: and Joab said, To day thy servant
           knoweth that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king,
           in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant.

10:014:023 So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to
           Jerusalem.

10:014:024 And the king said, Let him turn to his own house, and let him
           not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and saw
           not the king's face.

10:014:025 But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as
           Absalom for his beauty: from the sole of his foot even to the
           crown of his head there was no blemish in him.

10:014:026 And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end
           that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him,
           therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at
           two hundred shekels after the king's weight.

10:014:027 And unto Absalom there were born three sons, and one daughter,
           whose name was Tamar: she was a woman of a fair countenance.

10:014:028 So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the
           king's face.

10:014:029 Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king;
           but he would not come to him: and when he sent again the
           second time, he would not come.

10:014:030 Therefore he said unto his servants, See, Joab's field is near
           mine, and he hath barley there; go and set it on fire. And
           Absalom's servants set the field on fire.

10:014:031 Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house, and said
           unto him, Wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire?

10:014:032 And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I sent unto thee, saying,
           Come hither, that I may send thee to the king, to say,
           Wherefore am I come from Geshur? it had been good for me to
           have been there still: now therefore let me see the king's
           face; and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.

10:014:033 So Joab came to the king, and told him: and when he had called
           for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himself on his
           face to the ground before the king: and the king kissed
           Absalom.

10:015:001 And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him
           chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.

10:015:002 And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the
           gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy
           came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto him,
           and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy servant is
           of one of the tribes of Israel.

10:015:003 And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and
           right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.

10:015:004 Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land,
           that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto
           me, and I would do him justice!

10:015:005 And it was so, that when any man came nigh to him to do him
           obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed
           him.

10:015:006 And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the
           king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of
           Israel.

10:015:007 And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said unto
           the king, I pray thee, let me go and pay my vow, which I have
           vowed unto the LORD, in Hebron.

10:015:008 For thy servant vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria,
           saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem,
           then I will serve the LORD.

10:015:009 And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went
           to Hebron.

10:015:010 But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel,
           saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet, then ye
           shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.

10:015:011 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that
           were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew
           not any thing.

10:015:012 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's
           counsellor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered
           sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people
           increased continually with Absalom.

10:015:013 And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the
           men of Israel are after Absalom.

10:015:014 And David said unto all his servants that were with him at
           Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else
           escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us
           suddenly, and bring evil upon us, and smite the city with the
           edge of the sword.

10:015:015 And the king's servants said unto the king, Behold, thy
           servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall
           appoint.

10:015:016 And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And
           the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the
           house.

10:015:017 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and
           tarried in a place that was far off.

10:015:018 And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the
           Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six
           hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before
           the king.

10:015:019 Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou
           also with us? return to thy place, and abide with the king:
           for thou art a stranger, and also an exile.

10:015:020 Whereas thou camest but yesterday, should I this day make thee
           go up and down with us? seeing I go whither I may, return
           thou, and take back thy brethren: mercy and truth be with
           thee.

10:015:021 And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD liveth, and
           as my lord the king liveth, surely in what place my lord the
           king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will
           thy servant be.

10:015:022 And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the
           Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones
           that were with him.

10:015:023 And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people
           passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook
           Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the
           wilderness.

10:015:024 And lo Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing
           the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of
           God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done
           passing out of the city.

10:015:025 And the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into
           the city: if I shall find favour in the eyes of the LORD, he
           will bring me again, and shew me both it, and his habitation:

10:015:026 But if he thus say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am
           I, let him do to me as seemeth good unto him.

10:015:027 The king said also unto Zadok the priest, Art not thou a seer?
           return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you,
           Ahimaaz thy son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.

10:015:028 See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there
           come word from you to certify me.

10:015:029 Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to
           Jerusalem: and they tarried there.

10:015:030 And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as
           he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot:
           and all the people that was with him covered every man his
           head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.

10:015:031 And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the
           conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray
           thee, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.

10:015:032 And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of
           the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite
           came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth upon his head:

10:015:033 Unto whom David said, If thou passest on with me, then thou
           shalt be a burden unto me:

10:015:034 But if thou return to the city, and say unto Absalom, I will
           be thy servant, O king; as I have been thy father's servant
           hitherto, so will I now also be thy servant: then mayest thou
           for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.

10:015:035 And hast thou not there with thee Zadok and Abiathar the
           priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever thou
           shalt hear out of the king's house, thou shalt tell it to
           Zadok and Abiathar the priests.

10:015:036 Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz
           Zadok's son, and Jonathan Abiathar's son; and by them ye shall
           send unto me every thing that ye can hear.

10:015:037 So Hushai David's friend came into the city, and Absalom came
           into Jerusalem.

10:016:001 And when David was a little past the top of the hill, behold,
           Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him, with a couple of
           asses saddled, and upon them two hundred loaves of bread, and
           an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer
           fruits, and a bottle of wine.

10:016:002 And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And
           Ziba said, The asses be for the king's household to ride on;
           and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and
           the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink.

10:016:003 And the king said, And where is thy master's son? And Ziba
           said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he
           said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom
           of my father.

10:016:004 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that
           pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech
           thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.

10:016:005 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a
           man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei,
           the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.

10:016:006 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king
           David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his
           right hand and on his left.

10:016:007 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou
           bloody man, and thou man of Belial:

10:016:008 The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of
           Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath
           delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and,
           behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a
           bloody man.

10:016:009 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should
           this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray
           thee, and take off his head.

10:016:010 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
           Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto
           him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done
           so?

10:016:011 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my
           son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much
           more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him
           curse; for the LORD hath bidden him.

10:016:012 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that
           the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day.

10:016:013 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on
           the hill's side over against him, and cursed as he went, and
           threw stones at him, and cast dust.

10:016:014 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came
           weary, and refreshed themselves there.

10:016:015 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to
           Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.

10:016:016 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David's friend,
           was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save
           the king, God save the king.

10:016:017 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy
           friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend?

10:016:018 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this
           people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and
           with him will I abide.

10:016:019 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the
           presence of his son? as I have served in thy father's
           presence, so will I be in thy presence.

10:016:020 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what
           we shall do.

10:016:021 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father's
           concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all
           Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then
           shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong.

10:016:022 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and
           Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of
           all Israel.

10:016:023 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those
           days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so
           was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with
           Absalom.

10:017:001 Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out
           twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David
           this night:

10:017:002 And I will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed,
           and will make him afraid: and all the people that are with him
           shall flee; and I will smite the king only:

10:017:003 And I will bring back all the people unto thee: the man whom
           thou seekest is as if all returned: so all the people shall be
           in peace.

10:017:004 And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of
           Israel.

10:017:005 Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let
           us hear likewise what he saith.

10:017:006 And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake unto him,
           saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this manner: shall we do
           after his saying? if not; speak thou.

10:017:007 And Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel hath
           given is not good at this time.

10:017:008 For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that
           they be mighty men, and they be chafed in their minds, as a
           bear robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father is a
           man of war, and will not lodge with the people.

10:017:009 Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some other place: and
           it will come to pass, when some of them be overthrown at the
           first, that whosoever heareth it will say, There is a
           slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.

10:017:010 And he also that is valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a
           lion, shall utterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy
           father is a mighty man, and they which be with him are valiant
           men.

10:017:011 Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto
           thee, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the
           sea for multitude; and that thou go to battle in thine own
           person.

10:017:012 So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be
           found, and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the
           ground: and of him and of all the men that are with him there
           shall not be left so much as one.

10:017:013 Moreover, if he be gotten into a city, then shall all Israel
           bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river,
           until there be not one small stone found there.

10:017:014 And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of
           Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahithophel.
           For the LORD had appointed to defeat the good counsel of
           Ahithophel, to the intent that the LORD might bring evil upon
           Absalom.

10:017:015 Then said Hushai unto Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, Thus
           and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of
           Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.

10:017:016 Now therefore send quickly, and tell David, saying, Lodge not
           this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass
           over; lest the king be swallowed up, and all the people that
           are with him.

10:017:017 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel; for they might not
           be seen to come into the city: and a wench went and told them;
           and they went and told king David.

10:017:018 Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went
           both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in
           Bahurim, which had a well in his court; whither they went
           down.

10:017:019 And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's
           mouth, and spread ground corn thereon; and the thing was not
           known.

10:017:020 And when Absalom's servants came to the woman to the house,
           they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said
           unto them, They be gone over the brook of water. And when they
           had sought and could not find them, they returned to
           Jerusalem.

10:017:021 And it came to pass, after they were departed, that they came
           up out of the well, and went and told king David, and said
           unto David, Arise, and pass quickly over the water: for thus
           hath Ahithophel counselled against you.

10:017:022 Then David arose, and all the people that were with him, and
           they passed over Jordan: by the morning light there lacked not
           one of them that was not gone over Jordan.

10:017:023 And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he
           saddled his ass, and arose, and gat him home to his house, to
           his city, and put his household in order, and hanged himself,
           and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.

10:017:024 Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan,
           he and all the men of Israel with him.

10:017:025 And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab:
           which Amasa was a man's son, whose name was Ithra an
           Israelite, that went in to Abigail the daughter of Nahash,
           sister to Zeruiah Joab's mother.

10:017:026 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.

10:017:027 And it came to pass, when David was come to Mahanaim, that
           Shobi the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon,
           and Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the
           Gileadite of Rogelim,

10:017:028 Brought beds, and basons, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and
           barley, and flour, and parched corn, and beans, and lentiles,
           and parched pulse,

10:017:029 And honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheese of kine, for
           David, and for the people that were with him, to eat: for they
           said, The people is hungry, and weary, and thirsty, in the
           wilderness.

10:018:001 And David numbered the people that were with him, and set
           captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds over them.

10:018:002 And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand
           of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abishai the son of
           Zeruiah, Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of
           Ittai the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will
           surely go forth with you myself also.

10:018:003 But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth: for if we
           flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us
           die, will they care for us: but now thou art worth ten
           thousand of us: therefore now it is better that thou succour
           us out of the city.

10:018:004 And the king said unto them, What seemeth you best I will do.
           And the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came
           out by hundreds and by thousands.

10:018:005 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying,
           Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.
           And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains
           charge concerning Absalom.

10:018:006 So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the
           battle was in the wood of Ephraim;

10:018:007 Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of
           David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of
           twenty thousand men.

10:018:008 For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the
           country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the
           sword devoured.

10:018:009 And Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a
           mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak,
           and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up
           between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under
           him went away.

10:018:010 And a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I
           saw Absalom hanged in an oak.

10:018:011 And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou
           sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the
           ground? and I would have given thee ten shekels of silver, and
           a girdle.

10:018:012 And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand
           shekels of silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine
           hand against the king's son: for in our hearing the king
           charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that none
           touch the young man Absalom.

10:018:013 Otherwise I should have wrought falsehood against mine own
           life: for there is no matter hid from the king, and thou
           thyself wouldest have set thyself against me.

10:018:014 Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took
           three darts in his hand, and thrust them through the heart of
           Absalom, while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.

10:018:015 And ten young men that bare Joab's armour compassed about and
           smote Absalom, and slew him.

10:018:016 And Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from
           pursuing after Israel: for Joab held back the people.

10:018:017 And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the
           wood, and laid a very great heap of stones upon him: and all
           Israel fled every one to his tent.

10:018:018 Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for
           himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I
           have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the
           pillar after his own name: and it is called unto this day,
           Absalom's place.

10:018:019 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear
           the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his
           enemies.

10:018:020 And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day,
           but thou shalt bear tidings another day: but this day thou
           shalt bear no tidings, because the king's son is dead.

10:018:021 Then said Joab to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen.
           And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.

10:018:022 Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But
           howsoever, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab
           said, Wherefore wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou hast
           no tidings ready?

10:018:023 But howsoever, said he, let me run. And he said unto him, Run.
           Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain, and overran Cushi.

10:018:024 And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up
           to the roof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his
           eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.

10:018:025 And the watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said,
           If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he came
           apace, and drew near.

10:018:026 And the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman
           called unto the porter, and said, Behold another man running
           alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.

10:018:027 And the watchman said, Me thinketh the running of the foremost
           is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king
           said, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.

10:018:028 And Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And
           he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and
           said, Blessed be the LORD thy God, which hath delivered up the
           men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king.

10:018:029 And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz
           answered, When Joab sent the king's servant, and me thy
           servant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was.

10:018:030 And the king said unto him, Turn aside, and stand here. And he
           turned aside, and stood still.

10:018:031 And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the
           king: for the LORD hath avenged thee this day of all them that
           rose up against thee.

10:018:032 And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe?
           And Cushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all
           that rise against thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man
           is.

10:018:033 And the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over
           the gate, and wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son
           Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! would God I had died for
           thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!

10:019:001 And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth
           for Absalom.

10:019:002 And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the
           people: for the people heard say that day how the king was
           grieved for his son.

10:019:003 And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as
           people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.

10:019:004 But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud
           voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!

10:019:005 And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast
           shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day
           have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy
           daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy
           concubines;

10:019:006 In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For
           thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither
           princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom
           had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased
           thee well.

10:019:007 Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy
           servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there
           will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be
           worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy
           youth until now.

10:019:008 Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto
           all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate.
           And all the people came before the king: for Israel had fled
           every man to his tent.

10:019:009 And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of
           Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our
           enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the
           Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom.

10:019:010 And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now
           therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back?

10:019:011 And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests,
           saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why are ye the
           last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of
           all Israel is come to the king, even to his house.

10:019:012 Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore
           then are ye the last to bring back the king?

10:019:013 And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh?
           God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the
           host before me continually in the room of Joab.

10:019:014 And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the
           heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king,
           Return thou, and all thy servants.

10:019:015 So the king returned, and came to Jordan. And Judah came to
           Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over
           Jordan.

10:019:016 And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,
           hasted and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David.

10:019:017 And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him, and Ziba
           the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and his
           twenty servants with him; and they went over Jordan before the
           king.

10:019:018 And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's
           household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son
           of Gera fell down before the king, as he was come over Jordan;

10:019:019 And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto
           me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did
           perversely the day that my lord the king went out of
           Jerusalem, that the king should take it to his heart.

10:019:020 For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore,
           behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of
           Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.

10:019:021 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not
           Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's
           anointed?

10:019:022 And David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of
           Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall
           there any man be put to death this day in Israel? for do not I
           know that I am this day king over Israel?

10:019:023 Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And
           the king sware unto him.

10:019:024 And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king,
           and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor
           washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the
           day he came again in peace.

10:019:025 And it came to pass, when he was come to Jerusalem to meet the
           king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou
           with me, Mephibosheth?

10:019:026 And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for
           thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride
           thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame.

10:019:027 And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but
           my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is
           good in thine eyes.

10:019:028 For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord
           the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did
           eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry
           any more unto the king?

10:019:029 And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy
           matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land.

10:019:030 And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all,
           forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his
           own house.

10:019:031 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went
           over Jordan with the king, to conduct him over Jordan.

10:019:032 Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old:
           and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at
           Mahanaim; for he was a very great man.

10:019:033 And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and
           I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.

10:019:034 And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live,
           that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?

10:019:035 I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between
           good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I
           drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and
           singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a
           burden unto my lord the king?

10:019:036 Thy servant will go a little way over Jordan with the king:
           and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?

10:019:037 Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die
           in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and
           of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over
           with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto
           thee.

10:019:038 And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I
           will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and
           whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee.

10:019:039 And all the people went over Jordan. And when the king was
           come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he
           returned unto his own place.

10:019:040 Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him:
           and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half
           the people of Israel.

10:019:041 And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king, and said
           unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah stolen
           thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and
           all David's men with him, over Jordan?

10:019:042 And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because
           the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for
           this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath
           he given us any gift?

10:019:043 And the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We
           have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in
           David than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice
           should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the
           words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the
           men of Israel.

10:020:001 And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was
           Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet,
           and said, We have no part in David, neither have we
           inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O
           Israel.

10:020:002 So every man of Israel went up from after David, and followed
           Sheba the son of Bichri: but the men of Judah clave unto their
           king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.

10:020:003 And David came to his house at Jerusalem; and the king took
           the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the
           house, and put them in ward, and fed them, but went not in
           unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death,
           living in widowhood.

10:020:004 Then said the king to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah
           within three days, and be thou here present.

10:020:005 So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah: but he tarried
           longer than the set time which he had appointed him.

10:020:006 And David said to Abishai, Now shall Sheba the son of Bichri
           do us more harm than did Absalom: take thou thy lord's
           servants, and pursue after him, lest he get him fenced cities,
           and escape us.

10:020:007 And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites,
           and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out
           of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

10:020:008 When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa
           went before them. And Joab's garment that he had put on was
           girded unto him, and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened
           upon his loins in the sheath thereof; and as he went forth it
           fell out.

10:020:009 And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in health, my brother? And
           Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.

10:020:010 But Amasa took no heed to the sword that was in Joab's hand:
           so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib, and shed out his
           bowels to the ground, and struck him not again; and he died.
           So Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba the son of
           Bichri.

10:020:011 And one of Joab's men stood by him, and said, He that
           favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after
           Joab.

10:020:012 And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And
           when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed
           Amasa out of the highway into the field, and cast a cloth upon
           him, when he saw that every one that came by him stood still.

10:020:013 When he was removed out of the highway, all the people went on
           after Joab, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.

10:020:014 And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel, and to
           Bethmaachah, and all the Berites: and they were gathered
           together, and went also after him.

10:020:015 And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and
           they cast up a bank against the city, and it stood in the
           trench: and all the people that were with Joab battered the
           wall, to throw it down.

10:020:016 Then cried a wise woman out of the city, Hear, hear; say, I
           pray you, unto Joab, Come near hither, that I may speak with
           thee.

10:020:017 And when he was come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou
           Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear
           the words of thine handmaid. And he answered, I do hear.

10:020:018 Then she spake, saying, They were wont to speak in old time,
           saying, They shall surely ask counsel at Abel: and so they
           ended the matter.

10:020:019 I am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in Israel:
           thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in Israel: why
           wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the LORD?

10:020:020 And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that
           I should swallow up or destroy.

10:020:021 The matter is not so: but a man of mount Ephraim, Sheba the
           son of Bichri by name, hath lifted up his hand against the
           king, even against David: deliver him only, and I will depart
           from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head
           shall be thrown to thee over the wall.

10:020:022 Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And
           they cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri, and cast it
           out to Joab. And he blew a trumpet, and they retired from the
           city, every man to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem
           unto the king.

10:020:023 Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son
           of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:

10:020:024 And Adoram was over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat the son of
           Ahilud was recorder:

10:020:025 And Sheva was scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests:

10:020:026 And Ira also the Jairite was a chief ruler about David.

10:021:001 Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year
           after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD
           answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he
           slew the Gibeonites.

10:021:002 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now
           the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the
           remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn
           unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the
           children of Israel and Judah.)

10:021:003 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
           you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may
           bless the inheritance of the LORD?

10:021:004 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor
           gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill
           any man in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I
           do for you.

10:021:005 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
           devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining
           in any of the coasts of Israel,

10:021:006 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will
           hang them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD
           did choose. And the king said, I will give them.

10:021:007 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son
           of Saul, because of the LORD's oath that was between them,
           between David and Jonathan the son of Saul.

10:021:008 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
           whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five
           sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for
           Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:

10:021:009 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and
           they hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell
           all seven together, and were put to death in the days of
           harvest, in the first days, in the beginning of barley
           harvest.

10:021:010 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
           for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until
           water dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither
           the birds of the air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of
           the field by night.

10:021:011 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
           concubine of Saul, had done.

10:021:012 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
           Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had
           stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines
           had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in
           Gilboa:

10:021:013 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones
           of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that
           were hanged.

10:021:014 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
           country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his
           father: and they performed all that the king commanded. And
           after that God was intreated for the land.

10:021:015 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
           David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against
           the Philistines: and David waxed faint.

10:021:016 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
           of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in
           weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have
           slain David.

10:021:017 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
           Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto
           him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that
           thou quench not the light of Israel.

10:021:018 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
           with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite
           slew Saph, which was of the sons of the giant.

10:021:019 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines,
           where Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the
           brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was
           like a weaver's beam.

10:021:020 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
           stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot
           six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to
           the giant.

10:021:021 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
           brother of David slew him.

10:021:022 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the
           hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

10:022:001 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the
           day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his
           enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:

10:022:002 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my
           deliverer;

10:022:003 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and
           the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my
           saviour; thou savest me from violence.

10:022:004 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall
           I be saved from mine enemies.

10:022:005 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly
           men made me afraid;

10:022:006 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death
           prevented me;

10:022:007 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God:
           and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did
           enter into his ears.

10:022:008 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
           moved and shook, because he was wroth.

10:022:009 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
           mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

10:022:010 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was
           under his feet.

10:022:011 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon
           the wings of the wind.

10:022:012 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,
           and thick clouds of the skies.

10:022:013 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.

10:022:014 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
           voice.

10:022:015 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
           discomfited them.

10:022:016 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
           world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the
           blast of the breath of his nostrils.

10:022:017 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;

10:022:018 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
           me: for they were too strong for me.

10:022:019 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
           my stay.

10:022:020 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
           because he delighted in me.

10:022:021 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according
           to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

10:022:022 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
           departed from my God.

10:022:023 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes,
           I did not depart from them.

10:022:024 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
           iniquity.

10:022:025 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
           righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.

10:022:026 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with
           the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.

10:022:027 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
           froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.

10:022:028 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are
           upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.

10:022:029 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
           darkness.

10:022:030 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I
           leaped over a wall.

10:022:031 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
           he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.

10:022:032 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our
           God?

10:022:033 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

10:022:034 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet: and setteth me upon my
           high places.

10:022:035 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken
           by mine arms.

10:022:036 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
           gentleness hath made me great.

10:022:037 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
           slip.

10:022:038 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned
           not again until I had consumed them.

10:022:039 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could
           not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.

10:022:040 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that
           rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.

10:022:041 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I
           might destroy them that hate me.

10:022:042 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD,
           but he answered them not.

10:022:043 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
           stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them
           abroad.

10:022:044 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
           thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I
           knew not shall serve me.

10:022:045 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they
           hear, they shall be obedient unto me.

10:022:046 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of
           their close places.

10:022:047 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the
           God of the rock of my salvation.

10:022:048 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
           under me.

10:022:049 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
           lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou
           hast delivered me from the violent man.

10:022:050 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
           heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.

10:022:051 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy
           to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.

10:023:001 Now these be the last words of David. David the son of Jesse
           said, and the man who was raised up on high, the anointed of
           the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,

10:023:002 The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word was in my
           tongue.

10:023:003 The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He
           that ruleth over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.

10:023:004 And he shall be as the light of the morning, when the sun
           riseth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender grass
           springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain.

10:023:005 Although my house be not so with God; yet he hath made with me
           an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure: for
           this is all my salvation, and all my desire, although he make
           it not to grow.

10:023:006 But the sons of Belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust
           away, because they cannot be taken with hands:

10:023:007 But the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and
           the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with
           fire in the same place.

10:023:008 These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The
           Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the
           same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight
           hundred, whom he slew at one time.

10:023:009 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of
           the three mighty men with David, when they defied the
           Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and
           the men of Israel were gone away:

10:023:010 He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary,
           and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a
           great victory that day; and the people returned after him only
           to spoil.

10:023:011 And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And
           the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was
           a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from
           the Philistines.

10:023:012 But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and
           slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.

10:023:013 And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in
           the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of
           the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.

10:023:014 And David was then in an hold, and the garrison of the
           Philistines was then in Bethlehem.

10:023:015 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
           the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!

10:023:016 And the three mighty men brake through the host of the
           Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that
           was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David:
           nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out
           unto the LORD.

10:023:017 And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this:
           is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of
           their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did
           these three mighty men.

10:023:018 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was
           chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three
           hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.

10:023:019 Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their
           captain: howbeit he attained not unto the first three.

10:023:020 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of
           Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of
           Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit
           in time of snow:

10:023:021 And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a
           spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and
           plucked the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him
           with his own spear.

10:023:022 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
           among three mighty men.

10:023:023 He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to
           the first three. And David set him over his guard.

10:023:024 Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan the
           son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

10:023:025 Shammah the Harodite, Elika the Harodite,

10:023:026 Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,

10:023:027 Abiezer the Anethothite, Mebunnai the Hushathite,

10:023:028 Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai the Netophathite,

10:023:029 Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite, Ittai the son of
           Ribai out of Gibeah of the children of Benjamin,

10:023:030 Benaiah the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,

10:023:031 Abialbon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,

10:023:032 Eliahba the Shaalbonite, of the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,

10:023:033 Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Hararite,

10:023:034 Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai, the son of the Maachathite,
           Eliam the son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,

10:023:035 Hezrai the Carmelite, Paarai the Arbite,

10:023:036 Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,

10:023:037 Zelek the Ammonite, Nahari the Beerothite, armourbearer to
           Joab the son of Zeruiah,

10:023:038 Ira an Ithrite, Gareb an Ithrite,

10:023:039 Uriah the Hittite: thirty and seven in all.

10:024:001 And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel,
           and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and
           Judah.

10:024:002 For the king said to Joab the captain of the host, which was
           with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan
           even to Beersheba, and number ye the people, that I may know
           the number of the people.

10:024:003 And Joab said unto the king, Now the LORD thy God add unto the
           people, how many soever they be, an hundredfold, and that the
           eyes of my lord the king may see it: but why doth my lord the
           king delight in this thing?

10:024:004 Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and
           against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of
           the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the
           people of Israel.

10:024:005 And they passed over Jordan, and pitched in Aroer, on the
           right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of
           Gad, and toward Jazer:

10:024:006 Then they came to Gilead, and to the land of Tahtimhodshi; and
           they came to Danjaan, and about to Zidon,

10:024:007 And came to the strong hold of Tyre, and to all the cities of
           the Hivites, and of the Canaanites: and they went out to the
           south of Judah, even to Beersheba.

10:024:008 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to
           Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.

10:024:009 And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the
           king: and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant
           men that drew the sword; and the men of Judah were five
           hundred thousand men.

10:024:010 And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the
           people. And David said unto the LORD, I have sinned greatly in
           that I have done: and now, I beseech thee, O LORD, take away
           the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

10:024:011 For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD
           came unto the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,

10:024:012 Go and say unto David, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee three
           things; choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.

10:024:013 So Gad came to David, and told him, and said unto him, Shall
           seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? or wilt thou
           flee three months before thine enemies, while they pursue
           thee? or that there be three days' pestilence in thy land? now
           advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent
           me.

10:024:014 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let us fall
           now into the hand of the LORD; for his mercies are great: and
           let me not fall into the hand of man.

10:024:015 So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning
           even to the time appointed: and there died of the people from
           Dan even to Beersheba seventy thousand men.

10:024:016 And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
           destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the
           angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now thine
           hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshingplace of
           Araunah the Jebusite.

10:024:017 And David spake unto the LORD when he saw the angel that smote
           the people, and said, Lo, I have sinned, and I have done
           wickedly: but these sheep, what have they done? let thine
           hand, I pray thee, be against me, and against my father's
           house.

10:024:018 And Gad came that day to David, and said unto him, Go up, rear
           an altar unto the LORD in the threshingfloor of Araunah the
           Jebusite.

10:024:019 And David, according to the saying of Gad, went up as the LORD
           commanded.

10:024:020 And Araunah looked, and saw the king and his servants coming
           on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himself before
           the king on his face upon the ground.

10:024:021 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the king come to his
           servant? And David said, To buy the threshingfloor of thee, to
           build an altar unto the LORD, that the plague may be stayed
           from the people.

10:024:022 And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and
           offer up what seemeth good unto him: behold, here be oxen for
           burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments and other
           instruments of the oxen for wood.

10:024:023 All these things did Araunah, as a king, give unto the king.
           And Araunah said unto the king, The LORD thy God accept thee.

10:024:024 And the king said unto Araunah, Nay; but I will surely buy it
           of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings unto
           the LORD my God of that which doth cost me nothing. So David
           bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of
           silver.

10:024:025 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
           burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was intreated
           for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.

Book 11        1 Kings

11:001:001 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they covered
           him with clothes, but he gat no heat.

11:001:002 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for
           my lord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the
           king, and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom,
           that my lord the king may get heat.

11:001:003 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of
           Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the
           king.

11:001:004 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, and
           ministered to him: but the king knew her not.

11:001:005 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I
           will be king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and
           fifty men to run before him.

11:001:006 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying,
           Why hast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and
           his mother bare him after Absalom.

11:001:007 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with
           Abiathar the priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.

11:001:008 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and
           Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men
           which belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.

11:001:009 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone
           of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren
           the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:

11:001:010 But Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and
           Solomon his brother, he called not.

11:001:011 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,
           saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith
           doth reign, and David our lord knoweth it not?

11:001:012 Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel,
           that thou mayest save thine own life, and the life of thy son
           Solomon.

11:001:013 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst
           not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying,
           Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
           sit upon my throne? why then doth Adonijah reign?

11:001:014 Behold, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also
           will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.

11:001:015 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and the
           king was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto
           the king.

11:001:016 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And the
           king said, What wouldest thou?

11:001:017 And she said unto him, My lord, thou swarest by the LORD thy
           God unto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son
           shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.

11:001:018 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,
           thou knowest it not:

11:001:019 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance,
           and hath called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the
           priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thy
           servant hath he not called.

11:001:020 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon
           thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the
           throne of my lord the king after him.

11:001:021 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall
           sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be
           counted offenders.

11:001:022 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the
           prophet also came in.

11:001:023 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. And
           when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before
           the king with his face to the ground.

11:001:024 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah
           shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?

11:001:025 For he is gone down this day, and hath slain oxen and fat
           cattle and sheep in abundance, and hath called all the king's
           sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest;
           and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save
           king Adonijah.

11:001:026 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah
           the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not
           called.

11:001:027 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not
           shewed it unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my
           lord the king after him?

11:001:028 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she
           came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.

11:001:029 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hath
           redeemed my soul out of all distress,

11:001:030 Even as I sware unto thee by the LORD God of Israel, saying,
           Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall
           sit upon my throne in my stead; even so will I certainly do
           this day.

11:001:031 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did
           reverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live
           for ever.

11:001:032 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the
           prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before
           the king.

11:001:033 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of
           your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own
           mule, and bring him down to Gihon:

11:001:034 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him
           there king over Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say,
           God save king Solomon.

11:001:035 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon
           my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have
           appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.

11:001:036 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,
           Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.

11:001:037 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he
           with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of
           my lord king David.

11:001:038 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the
           son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went
           down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and
           brought him to Gihon.

11:001:039 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the
           tabernacle, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet;
           and all the people said, God save king Solomon.

11:001:040 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped
           with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth
           rent with the sound of them.

11:001:041 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as
           they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound
           of the trumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city
           being in an uproar?

11:001:042 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar
           the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; for thou
           art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.

11:001:043 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord
           king David hath made Solomon king.

11:001:044 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan
           the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the
           Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to
           ride upon the king's mule:

11:001:045 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him
           king in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so
           that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have
           heard.

11:001:046 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.

11:001:047 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king
           David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy
           name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the
           king bowed himself upon the bed.

11:001:048 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of
           Israel, which hath given one to sit on my throne this day,
           mine eyes even seeing it.

11:001:049 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and
           rose up, and went every man his way.

11:001:050 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went,
           and caught hold on the horns of the altar.

11:001:051 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth king
           Solomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the
           altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he
           will not slay his servant with the sword.

11:001:052 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, there
           shall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness
           shall be found in him, he shall die.

11:001:053 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the
           altar. And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and
           Solomon said unto him, Go to thine house.

11:002:001 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he
           charged Solomon his son, saying,

11:002:002 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and
           shew thyself a man;

11:002:003 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways,
           to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments,
           and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses,
           that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and
           whithersoever thou turnest thyself:

11:002:004 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning
           me, saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk
           before me in truth with all their heart and with all their
           soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on the throne
           of Israel.

11:002:005 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to
           me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of
           Israel, unto Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of
           Jether, whom he slew, and shed the blood of war in peace, and
           put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins,
           and in his shoes that were on his feet.

11:002:006 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar
           head go down to the grave in peace.

11:002:007 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite,
           and let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they
           came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.

11:002:008 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
           Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in
           the day when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me
           at Jordan, and I sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not
           put thee to death with the sword.

11:002:009 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man,
           and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar
           head bring thou down to the grave with blood.

11:002:010 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
           David.

11:002:011 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:
           seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
           reigned he in Jerusalem.

11:002:012 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
           kingdom was established greatly.

11:002:013 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother
           of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,
           Peaceably.

11:002:014 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she
           said, Say on.

11:002:015 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that
           all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit
           the kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother's: for
           it was his from the LORD.

11:002:016 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
           unto him, Say on.

11:002:017 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for
           he will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the
           Shunammite to wife.

11:002:018 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.

11:002:019 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him
           for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed
           himself unto her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a
           seat to be set for the king's mother; and she sat on his right
           hand.

11:002:020 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray
           thee, say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my
           mother: for I will not say thee nay.

11:002:021 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
           thy brother to wife.

11:002:022 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why
           dost thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him
           the kingdom also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him,
           and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.

11:002:023 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me,
           and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against
           his own life.

11:002:024 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me,
           and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made
           me an house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death
           this day.

11:002:025 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of
           Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.

11:002:026 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to
           Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death:
           but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou
           barest the ark of the LORD God before David my father, and
           because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was
           afflicted.

11:002:027 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the
           LORD; that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he
           spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.

11:002:028 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
           though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the
           tabernacle of the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the
           altar.

11:002:029 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
           tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then
           Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall
           upon him.

11:002:030 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
           him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I
           will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again,
           saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.

11:002:031 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
           him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent
           blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my
           father.

11:002:032 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who
           fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew
           them with the sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to
           wit, Abner the son of Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and
           Amasa the son of Jether, captain of the host of Judah.

11:002:033 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
           upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon
           his seed, and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there
           be peace for ever from the LORD.

11:002:034 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
           slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the
           wilderness.

11:002:035 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over
           the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of
           Abiathar.

11:002:036 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
           Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not
           forth thence any whither.

11:002:037 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest
           over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou
           shalt surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.

11:002:038 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord
           the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt
           in Jerusalem many days.

11:002:039 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
           servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of
           Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in
           Gath.

11:002:040 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to
           Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his
           servants from Gath.

11:002:041 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
           Gath, and was come again.

11:002:042 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
           Did I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto
           thee, saying, Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out,
           and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die?
           and thou saidst unto me, The word that I have heard is good.

11:002:043 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
           commandment that I have charged thee with?

11:002:044 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the
           wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to
           David my father: therefore the LORD shall return thy
           wickedness upon thine own head;

11:002:045 And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David
           shall be established before the LORD for ever.

11:002:046 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
           out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was
           established in the hand of Solomon.

11:003:001 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took
           Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David,
           until he had made an end of building his own house, and the
           house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.

11:003:002 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was
           no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.

11:003:003 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David
           his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high
           places.

11:003:004 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was
           the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon
           offer upon that altar.

11:003:005 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night:
           and God said, Ask what I shall give thee.

11:003:006 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David my
           father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in
           truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with
           thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that
           thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this
           day.

11:003:007 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king
           instead of David my father: and I am but a little child: I
           know not how to go out or come in.

11:003:008 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast
           chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted
           for multitude.

11:003:009 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy
           people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is
           able to judge this thy so great a people?

11:003:010 And the speech pleased the LORD, that Solomon had asked this
           thing.

11:003:011 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and
           hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked
           riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies;
           but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment;

11:003:012 Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given
           thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none
           like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like
           unto thee.

11:003:013 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked,
           both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among
           the kings like unto thee all thy days.

11:003:014 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my
           commandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will
           lengthen thy days.

11:003:015 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to
           Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace
           offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.

11:003:016 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king,
           and stood before him.

11:003:017 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in
           one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the
           house.

11:003:018 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,
           that this woman was delivered also: and we were together;
           there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the
           house.

11:003:019 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid
           it.

11:003:020 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me,
           while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid
           her dead child in my bosom.

11:003:021 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold,
           it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning,
           behold, it was not my son, which I did bear.

11:003:022 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and
           the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy
           son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the
           king.

11:003:023 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,
           and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son
           is the dead, and my son is the living.

11:003:024 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword
           before the king.

11:003:025 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give
           half to the one, and half to the other.

11:003:026 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,
           for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord,
           give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the
           other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.

11:003:027 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child,
           and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.

11:003:028 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had
           judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom
           of God was in him, to do judgment.

11:004:001 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.

11:004:002 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of
           Zadok the priest,

11:004:003 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat
           the son of Ahilud, the recorder.

11:004:004 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok
           and Abiathar were the priests:

11:004:005 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud
           the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's
           friend:

11:004:006 And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of
           Abda was over the tribute.

11:004:007 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which
           provided victuals for the king and his household: each man his
           month in a year made provision.

11:004:008 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:

11:004:009 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh,
           and Elonbethhanan:

11:004:010 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all
           the land of Hepher:

11:004:011 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had
           Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:

11:004:012 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
           and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from
           Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond
           Jokneam:

11:004:013 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns
           of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also
           pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore
           great cities with walls and brasen bars:

11:004:014 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:

11:004:015 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
           Solomon to wife:

11:004:016 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:

11:004:017 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:

11:004:018 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:

11:004:019 Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the
           country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of
           Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in the land.

11:004:020 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
           multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.

11:004:021 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
           land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they
           brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.

11:004:022 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of
           fine flour, and threescore measures of meal,

11:004:023 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an
           hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and
           fatted fowl.

11:004:024 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the
           river, from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this
           side the river: and he had peace on all sides round about him.

11:004:025 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine
           and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the
           days of Solomon.

11:004:026 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his
           chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.

11:004:027 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for
           all that came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his
           month: they lacked nothing.

11:004:028 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought
           they unto the place where the officers were, every man
           according to his charge.

11:004:029 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
           and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea
           shore.

11:004:030 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children
           of the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.

11:004:031 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
           Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame
           was in all nations round about.

11:004:032 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
           thousand and five.

11:004:033 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
           even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake
           also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of
           fishes.

11:004:034 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon,
           from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.

11:005:001 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he
           had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
           father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.

11:005:002 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,

11:005:003 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house
           unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were
           about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the
           soles of his feet.

11:005:004 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so
           that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.

11:005:005 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the
           LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying,
           Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall
           build an house unto my name.

11:005:006 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
           Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto
           thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that
           thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among
           us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.

11:005:007 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon,
           that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this
           day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this great
           people.

11:005:008 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the
           things which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy
           desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of
           fir.

11:005:009 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea:
           and I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that
           thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged
           there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish
           my desire, in giving food for my household.

11:005:010 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to
           all his desire.

11:005:011 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
           food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus
           gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.

11:005:012 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and
           there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a
           league together.

11:005:013 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
           was thirty thousand men.

11:005:014 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses:
           a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and
           Adoniram was over the levy.

11:005:015 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
           and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;

11:005:016 Beside the chief of Solomon's officers which were over the
           work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the
           people that wrought in the work.

11:005:017 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
           stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.

11:005:018 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and
           the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build
           the house.

11:006:001 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year
           after the children of Israel were come out of the land of
           Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in
           the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to
           build the house of the LORD.

11:006:002 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the
           length thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof
           twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.

11:006:003 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits
           was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house;
           and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.

11:006:004 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.

11:006:005 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round
           about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the
           temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:

11:006:006 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle
           was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad:
           for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests
           round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the
           walls of the house.

11:006:007 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone
           made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was
           neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the
           house, while it was in building.

11:006:008 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
           house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle
           chamber, and out of the middle into the third.

11:006:009 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house
           with beams and boards of cedar.

11:006:010 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
           high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.

11:006:011 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,

11:006:012 Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt
           walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my
           commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with
           thee, which I spake unto David thy father:

11:006:013 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not
           forsake my people Israel.

11:006:014 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.

11:006:015 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of
           cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the
           ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and
           covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.

11:006:016 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
           floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them
           for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy
           place.

11:006:017 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
           long.

11:006:018 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and
           open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.

11:006:019 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there
           the ark of the covenant of the LORD.

11:006:020 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length,
           and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height
           thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the
           altar which was of cedar.

11:006:021 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he
           made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and
           he overlaid it with gold.

11:006:022 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had
           finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the
           oracle he overlaid with gold.

11:006:023 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree,
           each ten cubits high.

11:006:024 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five
           cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part
           of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten
           cubits.

11:006:025 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were
           of one measure and one size.

11:006:026 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of
           the other cherub.

11:006:027 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
           stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing
           of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other
           cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one
           another in the midst of the house.

11:006:028 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.

11:006:029 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with
           carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers,
           within and without.

11:006:030 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
           without.

11:006:031 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive
           tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.

11:006:032 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
           carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and
           overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims,
           and upon the palm trees.

11:006:033 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive
           tree, a fourth part of the wall.

11:006:034 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
           door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were
           folding.

11:006:035 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open
           flowers: and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved
           work.

11:006:036 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone,
           and a row of cedar beams.

11:006:037 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
           laid, in the month Zif:

11:006:038 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the
           eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts
           thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he
           seven years in building it.

11:007:001 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he
           finished all his house.

11:007:002 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length
           thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty
           cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows
           of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.

11:007:003 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay
           on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.

11:007:004 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against
           light in three ranks.

11:007:005 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and
           light was against light in three ranks.

11:007:006 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty
           cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch
           was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were
           before them.

11:007:007 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even
           the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one
           side of the floor to the other.

11:007:008 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the
           porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house
           for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto
           this porch.

11:007:009 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of
           hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from
           the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward
           the great court.

11:007:010 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,
           stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.

11:007:011 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed
           stones, and cedars.

11:007:012 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed
           stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of
           the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.

11:007:013 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.

11:007:014 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father
           was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with
           wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in
           brass. And he came to king Solomon, and wrought all his work.

11:007:015 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high
           apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them
           about.

11:007:016 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the
           tops of the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five
           cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:

11:007:017 And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the
           chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars; seven for
           the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter.

11:007:018 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the one
           network, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, with
           pomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.

11:007:019 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were
           of lily work in the porch, four cubits.

11:007:020 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also
           above, over against the belly which was by the network: and
           the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the
           other chapiter.

11:007:021 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he
           set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin:
           and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof
           Boaz.

11:007:022 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work
           of the pillars finished.

11:007:023 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the
           other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits:
           and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

11:007:024 And under the brim of it round about there were knops
           compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about:
           the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.

11:007:025 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
           three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
           south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
           above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

11:007:026 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was
           wrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it
           contained two thousand baths.

11:007:027 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of
           one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three
           cubits the height of it.

11:007:028 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had
           borders, and the borders were between the ledges:

11:007:029 And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions,
           oxen, and cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base
           above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions
           made of thin work.

11:007:030 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass:
           and the four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver
           were undersetters molten, at the side of every addition.

11:007:031 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:
           but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a
           cubit and an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings
           with their borders, foursquare, not round.

11:007:032 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of
           the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel
           was a cubit and half a cubit.

11:007:033 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot
           wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes,
           and their spokes, were all molten.

11:007:034 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one
           base: and the undersetters were of the very base itself.

11:007:035 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a
           cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and
           the borders thereof were of the same.

11:007:036 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders
           thereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according
           to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.

11:007:037 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one
           casting, one measure, and one size.

11:007:038 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty
           baths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of
           the ten bases one laver.

11:007:039 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five
           on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right
           side of the house eastward over against the south.

11:007:040 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. So
           Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king
           Solomon for the house of the LORD:

11:007:041 The two pillars, and the two bowls of the chapiters that were
           on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover
           the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the
           pillars;

11:007:042 And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two
           rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls
           of the chapiters that were upon the pillars;

11:007:043 And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;

11:007:044 And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;

11:007:045 And the pots, and the shovels, and the basons: and all these
           vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the
           LORD, were of bright brass.

11:007:046 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
           ground between Succoth and Zarthan.

11:007:047 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were
           exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.

11:007:048 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house
           of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold,
           whereupon the shewbread was,

11:007:049 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and
           five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the
           lamps, and the tongs of gold,

11:007:050 And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basons, and the
           spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold,
           both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place,
           and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.

11:007:051 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house
           of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his
           father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the
           vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the
           LORD.

11:008:001 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
           of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
           Israel, unto king Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring
           up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of
           David, which is Zion.

11:008:002 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king
           Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the
           seventh month.

11:008:003 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the
           ark.

11:008:004 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of
           the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
           tabernacle, even those did the priests and the Levites bring
           up.

11:008:005 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that
           were assembled unto him, were with him before the ark,
           sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be told nor
           numbered for multitude.

11:008:006 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           unto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy
           place, even under the wings of the cherubims.

11:008:007 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place
           of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
           thereof above.

11:008:008 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves were
           seen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were
           not seen without: and there they are unto this day.

11:008:009 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone,
           which Moses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant
           with the children of Israel, when they came out of the land of
           Egypt.

11:008:010 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
           holy place, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD,

11:008:011 So that the priests could not stand to minister because of the
           cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of the
           LORD.

11:008:012 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in the
           thick darkness.

11:008:013 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled place
           for thee to abide in for ever.

11:008:014 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the
           congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel
           stood;)

11:008:015 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake
           with his mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand
           fulfilled it, saying,

11:008:016 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of
           Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to
           build an house, that my name might be therein; but I chose
           David to be over my people Israel.

11:008:017 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
           for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

11:008:018 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in
           thine heart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well
           that it was in thine heart.

11:008:019 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son that
           shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house
           unto my name.

11:008:020 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I am
           risen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne
           of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for
           the name of the LORD God of Israel.

11:008:021 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the
           covenant of the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he
           brought them out of the land of Egypt.

11:008:022 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence
           of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands
           toward heaven:

11:008:023 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in
           heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and
           mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their
           heart:

11:008:024 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thou
           promisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast
           fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

11:008:025 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David
           my father that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not
           fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so
           that thy children take heed to their way, that they walk
           before me as thou hast walked before me.

11:008:026 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be
           verified, which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.

11:008:027 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven and
           heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this
           house that I have builded?

11:008:028 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant, and to
           his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
           to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:

11:008:029 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day,
           even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall
           be there: that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy
           servant shall make toward this place.

11:008:030 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of
           thy people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and
           hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest,
           forgive.

11:008:031 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laid
           upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine
           altar in this house:

11:008:032 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thy servants,
           condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; and
           justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
           righteousness.

11:008:033 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy,
           because they have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to
           thee, and confess thy name, and pray, and make supplication
           unto thee in this house:

11:008:034 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people
           Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest
           unto their fathers.

11:008:035 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
           have sinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and
           confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou
           afflictest them:

11:008:036 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants,
           and of thy people Israel, that thou teach them the good way
           wherein they should walk, and give rain upon thy land, which
           thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.

11:008:037 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence,
           blasting, mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their
           enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever
           plague, whatsoever sickness there be;

11:008:038 What prayer and supplication soever be made by any man, or by
           all thy people Israel, which shall know every man the plague
           of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this
           house:

11:008:039 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and
           do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart
           thou knowest; (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of
           all the children of men;)

11:008:040 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in the
           land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

11:008:041 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people
           Israel, but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake;

11:008:042 (For they shall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong
           hand, and of thy stretched out arm;) when he shall come and
           pray toward this house;

11:008:043 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to
           all that the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of
           the earth may know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people
           Israel; and that they may know that this house, which I have
           builded, is called by thy name.

11:008:044 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy,
           whithersoever thou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the
           LORD toward the city which thou hast chosen, and toward the
           house that I have built for thy name:

11:008:045 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication,
           and maintain their cause.

11:008:046 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth
           not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the
           enemy, so that they carry them away captives unto the land of
           the enemy, far or near;

11:008:047 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they
           were carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto
           thee in the land of them that carried them captives, saying,
           We have sinned, and have done perversely, we have committed
           wickedness;

11:008:048 And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all
           their soul, in the land of their enemies, which led them away
           captive, and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou
           gavest unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen,
           and the house which I have built for thy name:

11:008:049 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven
           thy dwelling place, and maintain their cause,

11:008:050 And forgive thy people that have sinned against thee, and all
           their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against
           thee, and give them compassion before them who carried them
           captive, that they may have compassion on them:

11:008:051 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou
           broughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace
           of iron:

11:008:052 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy
           servant, and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to
           hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.

11:008:053 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of the
           earth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of
           Moses thy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of
           Egypt, O LORD God.

11:008:054 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying
           all this prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from
           before the altar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with
           his hands spread up to heaven.

11:008:055 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with
           a loud voice, saying,

11:008:056 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given rest unto his people
           Israel, according to all that he promised: there hath not
           failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by
           the hand of Moses his servant.

11:008:057 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let
           him not leave us, nor forsake us:

11:008:058 That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his
           ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his
           judgments, which he commanded our fathers.

11:008:059 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication
           before the LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night,
           that he maintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of
           his people Israel at all times, as the matter shall require:

11:008:060 That all the people of the earth may know that the LORD is
           God, and that there is none else.

11:008:061 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, to
           walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this
           day.

11:008:062 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice
           before the LORD.

11:008:063 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which he
           offered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an
           hundred and twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the
           children of Israel dedicated the house of the LORD.

11:008:064 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that
           was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
           offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace
           offerings: because the brasen altar that was before the LORD
           was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat
           offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.

11:008:065 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with
           him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto
           the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and
           seven days, even fourteen days.

11:008:066 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed
           the king, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart
           for all the goodness that the LORD had done for David his
           servant, and for Israel his people.

11:009:001 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of
           the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's
           desire which he was pleased to do,

11:009:002 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had
           appeared unto him at Gibeon.

11:009:003 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
           supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed
           this house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for
           ever; and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.

11:009:004 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked,
           in integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to
           all that I have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and
           my judgments:

11:009:005 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel
           for ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There
           shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.

11:009:006 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
           children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes
           which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods, and
           worship them:

11:009:007 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
           them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will
           I cast out of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a
           byword among all people:

11:009:008 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it
           shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why
           hath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?

11:009:009 And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their
           God, who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt,
           and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them,
           and served them: therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all
           this evil.

11:009:010 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon
           had built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the
           king's house,

11:009:011 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
           trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his
           desire,) that then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in
           the land of Galilee.

11:009:012 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon
           had given him; and they pleased him not.

11:009:013 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me,
           my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this
           day.

11:009:014 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.

11:009:015 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised;
           for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and
           Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and
           Gezer.

11:009:016 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and
           burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the
           city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's
           wife.

11:009:017 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,

11:009:018 And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,

11:009:019 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for
           his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which
           Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in
           all the land of his dominion.

11:009:020 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
           Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the
           children of Israel,

11:009:021 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the
           children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon
           those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.

11:009:022 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but
           they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and
           his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.

11:009:023 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon's
           work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people
           that wrought in the work.

11:009:024 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto
           her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build
           Millo.

11:009:025 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings
           and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the
           LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the
           LORD. So he finished the house.

11:009:026 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
           beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of
           Edom.

11:009:027 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
           knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.

11:009:028 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
           hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.

11:010:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon
           concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with
           hard questions.

11:010:002 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels
           that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and
           when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all
           that was in her heart.

11:010:003 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any
           thing hid from the king, which he told her not.

11:010:004 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, and
           the house that he had built,

11:010:005 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
           and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and
           his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the
           house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.

11:010:006 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in
           mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.

11:010:007 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes
           had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom
           and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.

11:010:008 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand
           continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.

11:010:009 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set
           thee on the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel
           for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and
           justice.

11:010:010 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
           and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there
           came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen
           of Sheba gave to king Solomon.

11:010:011 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,
           brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and
           precious stones.

11:010:012 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of
           the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries
           for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen
           unto this day.

11:010:013 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,
           whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of
           his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country,
           she and her servants.

11:010:014 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
           six hundred threescore and six talents of gold,

11:010:015 Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of
           the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of
           the governors of the country.

11:010:016 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
           hundred shekels of gold went to one target.

11:010:017 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound
           of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house
           of the forest of Lebanon.

11:010:018 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
           it with the best gold.

11:010:019 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round
           behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of
           the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.

11:010:020 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
           upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any
           kingdom.

11:010:021 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all
           the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure
           gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the
           days of Solomon.

11:010:022 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of
           Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish,
           bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

11:010:023 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches
           and for wisdom.

11:010:024 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which
           God had put in his heart.

11:010:025 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
           vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses,
           and mules, a rate year by year.

11:010:026 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he
           had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
           horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and
           with the king at Jerusalem.

11:010:027 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and
           cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the
           vale, for abundance.

11:010:028 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
           the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

11:010:029 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred
           shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and
           so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of
           Syria, did they bring them out by their means.

11:011:001 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with the
           daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites,
           Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites:

11:011:002 Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the
           children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall
           they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your
           heart after their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.

11:011:003 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
           concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.

11:011:004 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives
           turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not
           perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his
           father.

11:011:005 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
           and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.

11:011:006 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not
           fully after the LORD, as did David his father.

11:011:007 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the
           abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and
           for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.

11:011:008 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
           incense and sacrificed unto their gods.

11:011:009 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was
           turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto
           him twice,

11:011:010 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should
           not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD
           commanded.

11:011:011 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is
           done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my
           statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the
           kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.

11:011:012 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
           father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.

11:011:013 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give
           one tribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for
           Jerusalem's sake which I have chosen.

11:011:014 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
           Edomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.

11:011:015 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
           captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he
           had smitten every male in Edom;

11:011:016 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until
           he had cut off every male in Edom:)

11:011:017 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's
           servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little
           child.

11:011:018 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took
           men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto
           Pharaoh king of Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed
           him victuals, and gave him land.

11:011:019 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that
           he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of
           Tahpenes the queen.

11:011:020 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
           Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in
           Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh.

11:011:021 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his
           fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad
           said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own
           country.

11:011:022 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
           that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he
           answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.

11:011:023 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
           Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:

11:011:024 And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band,
           when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and
           dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.

11:011:025 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
           beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel,
           and reigned over Syria.

11:011:026 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
           Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow
           woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king.

11:011:027 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
           king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the
           city of David his father.

11:011:028 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
           seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him
           ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.

11:011:029 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
           Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in
           the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they
           two were alone in the field:

11:011:030 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it
           in twelve pieces:

11:011:031 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith
           the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom
           out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:

11:011:032 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake, and
           for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out of all
           the tribes of Israel:)

11:011:033 Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped
           Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the
           Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and
           have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine
           eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David
           his father.

11:011:034 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but
           I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my
           servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments
           and my statutes:

11:011:035 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will
           give it unto thee, even ten tribes.

11:011:036 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
           may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which
           I have chosen me to put my name there.

11:011:037 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all
           that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.

11:011:038 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
           thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my
           sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my
           servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure
           house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.

11:011:039 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for
           ever.

11:011:040 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
           and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in
           Egypt until the death of Solomon.

11:011:041 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and
           his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of
           Solomon?

11:011:042 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
           was forty years.

11:011:043 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
           of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
           stead.

11:012:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to
           Shechem to make him king.

11:012:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
           yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence
           of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;)

11:012:003 That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the
           congregation of Israel came, and spake unto Rehoboam, saying,

11:012:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make thou the
           grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he
           put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.

11:012:005 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come
           again to me. And the people departed.

11:012:006 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood
           before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do
           ye advise that I may answer this people?

11:012:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a servant
           unto this people this day, and wilt serve them, and answer
           them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thy
           servants for ever.

11:012:008 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had
           given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up
           with him, and which stood before him:

11:012:009 And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer
           this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke
           which thy father did put upon us lighter?

11:012:010 And the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him,
           saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto
           thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
           lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little
           finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

11:012:011 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I
           will add to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with
           whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

11:012:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,
           as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third
           day.

11:012:013 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old
           men's counsel that they gave him;

11:012:014 And spake to them after the counsel of the young men, saying,
           My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke:
           my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
           you with scorpions.

11:012:015 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the
           cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying,
           which the LORD spake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the
           son of Nebat.

11:012:016 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,
           the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in
           David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to
           your tents, O Israel: now see to thine own house, David. So
           Israel departed unto their tents.

11:012:017 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities of
           Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

11:012:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and
           all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore
           king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee
           to Jerusalem.

11:012:019 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

11:012:020 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was
           come again, that they sent and called him unto the
           congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was
           none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah
           only.

11:012:021 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the
           house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and
           fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight
           against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to
           Rehoboam the son of Solomon.

11:012:022 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

11:012:023 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and
           unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant
           of the people, saying,

11:012:024 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
           your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his
           house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to
           the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the
           word of the LORD.

11:012:025 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt
           therein; and went out from thence, and built Penuel.

11:012:026 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return
           to the house of David:

11:012:027 If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD
           at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again
           unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and they
           shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.

11:012:028 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,
           and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to
           Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up
           out of the land of Egypt.

11:012:029 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.

11:012:030 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship
           before the one, even unto Dan.

11:012:031 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the
           lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.

11:012:032 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the
           fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in
           Judah, and he offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel,
           sacrificing unto the calves that he had made: and he placed in
           Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.

11:012:033 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel the
           fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he
           had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the
           children of Israel: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt
           incense.

11:013:001 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word
           of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to
           burn incense.

11:013:002 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and
           said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child
           shall be born unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and
           upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that
           burn incense upon thee, and men's bones shall be burnt upon
           thee.

11:013:003 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign
           which the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent,
           and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.

11:013:004 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of
           the man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel,
           that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on
           him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up,
           so that he could not pull it in again to him.

11:013:005 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the
           altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by
           the word of the LORD.

11:013:006 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat
           now the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my
           hand may be restored me again. And the man of God besought the
           LORD, and the king's hand was restored him again, and became
           as it was before.

11:013:007 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
           refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.

11:013:008 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me
           half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I
           eat bread nor drink water in this place:

11:013:009 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat
           no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that
           thou camest.

11:013:010 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he
           came to Bethel.

11:013:011 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came
           and told him all the works that the man of God had done that
           day in Bethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king,
           them they told also to their father.

11:013:012 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his
           sons had seen what way the man of God went, which came from
           Judah.

11:013:013 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
           him the ass: and he rode thereon,

11:013:014 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an
           oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest
           from Judah? And he said, I am.

11:013:015 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.

11:013:016 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
           neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this
           place:

11:013:017 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat
           no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the
           way that thou camest.

11:013:018 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an
           angel spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him
           back with thee into thine house, that he may eat bread and
           drink water. But he lied unto him.

11:013:019 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and
           drank water.

11:013:020 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word
           of the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:

11:013:021 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying,
           Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the
           mouth of the LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the
           LORD thy God commanded thee,

11:013:022 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the
           place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread,
           and drink no water; thy carcase shall not come unto the
           sepulchre of thy fathers.

11:013:023 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he
           had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the
           prophet whom he had brought back.

11:013:024 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
           and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it,
           the lion also stood by the carcase.

11:013:025 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the
           way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and
           told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.

11:013:026 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
           thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient
           unto the word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered
           him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him,
           according to the word of the LORD, which he spake unto him.

11:013:027 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
           saddled him.

11:013:028 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
           and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten
           the carcase, nor torn the ass.

11:013:029 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and
           laid it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet
           came to the city, to mourn and to bury him.

11:013:030 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned
           over him, saying, Alas, my brother!

11:013:031 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to
           his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the
           sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay my bones
           beside his bones:

11:013:032 For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against
           the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high
           places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come
           to pass.

11:013:033 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
           made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high
           places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one
           of the priests of the high places.

11:013:034 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to
           cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.

11:014:001 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.

11:014:002 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and
           disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of
           Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the
           prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people.

11:014:003 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
           honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of
           the child.

11:014:004 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
           came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his
           eyes were set by reason of his age.

11:014:005 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
           cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick:
           thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when
           she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another
           woman.

11:014:006 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she
           came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of
           Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am
           sent to thee with heavy tidings.

11:014:007 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
           Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made
           thee prince over my people Israel,

11:014:008 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it
           thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept
           my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do
           that only which was right in mine eyes;

11:014:009 But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou
           hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to
           provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:

11:014:010 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of
           Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth
           against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,
           and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a
           man taketh away dung, till it be all gone.

11:014:011 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and
           him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat:
           for the LORD hath spoken it.

11:014:012 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when
           thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.

11:014:013 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only
           of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is
           found some good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the
           house of Jeroboam.

11:014:014 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
           shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even
           now.

11:014:015 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
           water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land,
           which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond
           the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the
           LORD to anger.

11:014:016 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
           who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.

11:014:017 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
           and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child
           died;

11:014:018 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according
           to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his
           servant Ahijah the prophet.

11:014:019 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how
           he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the
           chronicles of the kings of Israel.

11:014:020 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
           and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in
           his stead.

11:014:021 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was
           forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
           seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did
           choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there.
           And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.

11:014:022 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
           him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed,
           above all that their fathers had done.

11:014:023 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves,
           on every high hill, and under every green tree.

11:014:024 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did
           according to all the abominations of the nations which the
           LORD cast out before the children of Israel.

11:014:025 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
           Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:

11:014:026 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and
           the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and
           he took away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.

11:014:027 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
           committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which
           kept the door of the king's house.

11:014:028 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,
           that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard
           chamber.

11:014:029 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

11:014:030 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their
           days.

11:014:031 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
           fathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah
           an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

11:015:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebat
           reigned Abijam over Judah.

11:015:002 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was
           Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

11:015:003 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done
           before him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his
           God, as the heart of David his father.

11:015:004 Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him a
           lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to
           establish Jerusalem:

11:015:005 Because David did that which was right in the eyes of the
           LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded
           him all the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah
           the Hittite.

11:015:006 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days
           of his life.

11:015:007 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.

11:015:008 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in the
           city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.

11:015:009 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned
           Asa over Judah.

11:015:010 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his
           mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.

11:015:011 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as
           did David his father.

11:015:012 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed
           all the idols that his fathers had made.

11:015:013 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from being
           queen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa
           destroyed her idol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.

11:015:014 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heart
           was perfect with the LORD all his days.

11:015:015 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated,
           and the things which himself had dedicated, into the house of
           the LORD, silver, and gold, and vessels.

11:015:016 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
           their days.

11:015:017 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and built
           Ramah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to
           Asa king of Judah.

11:015:018 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in
           the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
           the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his
           servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of
           Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelt at
           Damascus, saying,

11:015:019 There is a league between me and thee, and between my father
           and thy father: behold, I have sent unto thee a present of
           silver and gold; come and break thy league with Baasha king of
           Israel, that he may depart from me.

11:015:020 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
           the hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote
           Ijon, and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with
           all the land of Naphtali.

11:015:021 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left
           off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.

11:015:022 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none
           was exempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the
           timber thereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa
           built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.

11:015:023 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all
           that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
           Nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his
           feet.

11:015:024 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
           fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his
           son reigned in his stead.

11:015:025 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in
           the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel
           two years.

11:015:026 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
           way of his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
           sin.

11:015:027 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,
           conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon,
           which belonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel
           laid siege to Gibbethon.

11:015:028 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay
           him, and reigned in his stead.

11:015:029 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all the
           house of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed,
           until he had destroyed him, according unto the saying of the
           LORD, which he spake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite:

11:015:030 Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he
           made Israel sin, by his provocation wherewith he provoked the
           LORD God of Israel to anger.

11:015:031 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Israel?

11:015:032 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all
           their days.

11:015:033 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son of
           Ahijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four
           years.

11:015:034 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
           way of Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to
           sin.

11:016:001 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani
           against Baasha, saying,

11:016:002 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, and made thee
           prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in the way
           of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke
           me to anger with their sins;

11:016:003 Behold, I will take away the posterity of Baasha, and the
           posterity of his house; and will make thy house like the house
           of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

11:016:004 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and
           him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air
           eat.

11:016:005 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and his
           might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
           the kings of Israel?

11:016:006 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah:
           and Elah his son reigned in his stead.

11:016:007 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani
           came the word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his
           house, even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the
           LORD, in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in
           being like the house of Jeroboam; and because he killed him.

11:016:008 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah
           the son of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.

11:016:009 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired
           against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in
           the house of Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.

11:016:010 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twenty
           and seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his
           stead.

11:016:011 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat
           on his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left
           him not one that pisseth against a wall, neither of his
           kinsfolks, nor of his friends.

11:016:012 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to
           the word of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu
           the prophet.

11:016:013 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, by
           which they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in
           provoking the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

11:016:014 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Israel?

11:016:015 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimri
           reign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped
           against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.

11:016:016 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath
           conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel
           made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day
           in the camp.

11:016:017 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and
           they besieged Tirzah.

11:016:018 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,
           that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt
           the king's house over him with fire, and died.

11:016:019 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the
           LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which
           he did, to make Israel to sin.

11:016:020 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he
           wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
           the kings of Israel?

11:016:021 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of
           the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king;
           and half followed Omri.

11:016:022 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people
           that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri
           reigned.

11:016:023 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri
           to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in
           Tirzah.

11:016:024 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of
           silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city
           which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill,
           Samaria.

11:016:025 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse
           than all that were before him.

11:016:026 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and
           in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the
           LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.

11:016:027 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might
           that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the
           chronicles of the kings of Israel?

11:016:028 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and
           Ahab his son reigned in his stead.

11:016:029 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began
           Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of
           Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.

11:016:030 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD
           above all that were before him.

11:016:031 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him
           to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took
           to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians,
           and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.

11:016:032 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which
           he had built in Samaria.

11:016:033 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD
           God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were
           before him.

11:016:034 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the
           foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the
           gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word
           of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.

11:017:001 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,
           said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom
           I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but
           according to my word.

11:017:002 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

11:017:003 Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by
           the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

11:017:004 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I
           have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.

11:017:005 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for he
           went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.

11:017:006 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and
           bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.

11:017:007 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,
           because there had been no rain in the land.

11:017:008 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying,

11:017:009 Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and
           dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to
           sustain thee.

11:017:010 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the
           gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering
           of sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray
           thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.

11:017:011 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,
           Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.

11:017:012 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake,
           but an handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a
           cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go
           in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and
           die.

11:017:013 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast
           said: but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it
           unto me, and after make for thee and for thy son.

11:017:014 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal
           shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until
           the day that the LORD sendeth rain upon the earth.

11:017:015 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and
           she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.

11:017:016 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of
           oil fail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by
           Elijah.

11:017:017 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the
           woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness
           was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.

11:017:018 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou
           man of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to
           remembrance, and to slay my son?

11:017:019 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of
           her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where he abode, and
           laid him upon his own bed.

11:017:020 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thou
           also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by
           slaying her son?

11:017:021 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried
           unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let this
           child's soul come into him again.

11:017:022 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of the
           child came into him again, and he revived.

11:017:023 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the
           chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and
           Elijah said, See, thy son liveth.

11:017:024 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art
           a man of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is
           truth.

11:018:001 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD
           came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself
           unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.

11:018:002 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a
           sore famine in Samaria.

11:018:003 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
           (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:

11:018:004 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,
           that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty
           in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)

11:018:005 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all
           fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may
           find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose
           not all the beasts.

11:018:006 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
           Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by
           himself.

11:018:007 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
           knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my
           lord Elijah?

11:018:008 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah
           is here.

11:018:009 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver
           thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?

11:018:010 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,
           whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they
           said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and
           nation, that they found thee not.

11:018:011 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
           here.

11:018:012 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee,
           that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know
           not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find
           thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from
           my youth.

11:018:013 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
           prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's
           prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and
           water?

11:018:014 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
           here: and he shall slay me.

11:018:015 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
           stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.

11:018:016 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to
           meet Elijah.

11:018:017 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
           him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?

11:018:018 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy
           father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of
           the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.

11:018:019 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount
           Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and
           the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at
           Jezebel's table.

11:018:020 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
           prophets together unto mount Carmel.

11:018:021 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt
           ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but
           if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a
           word.

11:018:022 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a
           prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and
           fifty men.

11:018:023 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose
           one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it
           on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other
           bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:

11:018:024 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the
           name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him
           be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well
           spoken.

11:018:025 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
           bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many;
           and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.

11:018:026 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they
           dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even
           until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice,
           nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which
           was made.

11:018:027 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and
           said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he
           is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he
           sleepeth, and must be awaked.

11:018:028 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
           with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.

11:018:029 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
           until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that
           there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that
           regarded.

11:018:030 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And
           all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar
           of the LORD that was broken down.

11:018:031 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the
           tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD
           came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:

11:018:032 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD:
           and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would
           contain two measures of seed.

11:018:033 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces,
           and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with
           water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

11:018:034 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second
           time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the
           third time.

11:018:035 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
           trench also with water.

11:018:036 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
           sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD
           God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day
           that thou art God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and
           that I have done all these things at thy word.

11:018:037 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou
           art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back
           again.

11:018:038 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt
           sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and
           licked up the water that was in the trench.

11:018:039 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and
           they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.

11:018:040 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
           one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought
           them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.

11:018:041 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for
           there is a sound of abundance of rain.

11:018:042 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the
           top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and
           put his face between his knees,

11:018:043 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And
           he went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he
           said, Go again seven times.

11:018:044 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
           there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's
           hand. And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot,
           and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.

11:018:045 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was
           black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And
           Ahab rode, and went to Jezreel.

11:018:046 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
           loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.

11:019:001 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how
           he had slain all the prophets with the sword.

11:019:002 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the
           gods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the
           life of one of them by to morrow about this time.

11:019:003 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and
           came to Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his
           servant there.

11:019:004 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and
           came and sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for
           himself that he might die; and said, It is enough; now, O
           LORD, take away my life; for I am not better than my fathers.

11:019:005 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an
           angel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.

11:019:006 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the
           coals, and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and
           drink, and laid him down again.

11:019:007 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and
           touched him, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is
           too great for thee.

11:019:008 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength
           of that meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount
           of God.

11:019:009 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and,
           behold, the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto
           him, What doest thou here, Elijah?

11:019:010 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
           hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant,
           thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with the
           sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to
           take it away.

11:019:011 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the
           LORD. And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong
           wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before
           the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: and after the wind
           an earthquake; but the LORD was not in the earthquake:

11:019:012 And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the
           fire: and after the fire a still small voice.

11:019:013 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face
           in his mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of
           the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said,
           What doest thou here, Elijah?

11:019:014 And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of
           hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thy
           covenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets
           with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my
           life, to take it away.

11:019:015 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to the
           wilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to
           be king over Syria:

11:019:016 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over
           Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shalt
           thou anoint to be prophet in thy room.

11:019:017 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword of
           Hazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword
           of Jehu shall Elisha slay.

11:019:018 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees
           which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not
           kissed him.

11:019:019 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat,
           who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he
           with the twelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his
           mantle upon him.

11:019:020 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me,
           I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will
           follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again: for what
           have I done to thee?

11:019:021 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and
           slew them, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the
           oxen, and gave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he
           arose, and went after Elijah, and ministered unto him.

11:020:001 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:
           and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and
           chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred
           against it.

11:020:002 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city,
           and said unto him, Thus saith Benhadad,

11:020:003 Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy
           children, even the goodliest, are mine.

11:020:004 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,
           according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.

11:020:005 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh
           Benhadad, saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou
           shalt deliver me thy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and
           thy children;

11:020:006 Yet I will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this
           time, and they shall search thine house, and the houses of thy
           servants; and it shall be, that whatsoever is pleasant in
           thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand, and take it away.

11:020:007 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, and
           said, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief:
           for he sent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for
           my silver, and for my gold; and I denied him not.

11:020:008 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken
           not unto him, nor consent.

11:020:009 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my
           lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at
           the first I will do: but this thing I may not do. And the
           messengers departed, and brought him word again.

11:020:010 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,
           and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for
           handfuls for all the people that follow me.

11:020:011 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not
           him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that
           putteth it off.

11:020:012 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as he
           was drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said
           unto his servants, Set yourselves in array. And they set
           themselves in array against the city.

11:020:013 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,
           saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great
           multitude? behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day;
           and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.

11:020:014 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Even
           by the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he
           said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.

11:020:015 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the
           provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after
           them he numbered all the people, even all the children of
           Israel, being seven thousand.

11:020:016 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself
           drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two
           kings that helped him.

11:020:017 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out
           first; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There
           are men come out of Samaria.

11:020:018 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take them
           alive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.

11:020:019 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of
           the city, and the army which followed them.

11:020:020 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; and
           Israel pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on
           an horse with the horsemen.

11:020:021 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses and
           chariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.

11:020:022 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,
           Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for
           at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up
           against thee.

11:020:023 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their
           gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than
           we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we
           shall be stronger than they.

11:020:024 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of his
           place, and put captains in their rooms:

11:020:025 And number thee an army, like the army that thou hast lost,
           horse for horse, and chariot for chariot: and we will fight
           against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger
           than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.

11:020:026 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad
           numbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against
           Israel.

11:020:027 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all
           present, and went against them: and the children of Israel
           pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the
           Syrians filled the country.

11:020:028 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of
           Israel, and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians
           have said, The LORD is God of the hills, but he is not God of
           the valleys, therefore will I deliver all this great multitude
           into thine hand, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

11:020:029 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so
           it was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and the
           children of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand
           footmen in one day.

11:020:030 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall
           fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left.
           And Benhadad fled, and came into the city, into an inner
           chamber.

11:020:031 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that
           the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I
           pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our
           heads, and go out to the king of Israel: peradventure he will
           save thy life.

11:020:032 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on
           their heads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy
           servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said,
           Is he yet alive? he is my brother.

11:020:033 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would
           come from him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy
           brother Benhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then
           Benhadad came forth to him; and he caused him to come up into
           the chariot.

11:020:034 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took
           from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets
           for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said
           Ahab, I will send thee away with this covenant. So he made a
           covenant with him, and sent him away.

11:020:035 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his
           neighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And
           the man refused to smite him.

11:020:036 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice
           of the LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a
           lion shall slay thee. And as soon as he was departed from him,
           a lion found him, and slew him.

11:020:037 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee.
           And the man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.

11:020:038 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way,
           and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.

11:020:039 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he
           said, Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and,
           behold, a man turned aside, and brought a man unto me, and
           said, Keep this man: if by any means he be missing, then shall
           thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of
           silver.

11:020:040 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And
           the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be;
           thyself hast decided it.

11:020:041 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and the
           king of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.

11:020:042 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast
           let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter
           destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy
           people for his people.

11:020:043 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,
           and came to Samaria.

11:021:001 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the
           Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the
           palace of Ahab king of Samaria.

11:021:002 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that
           I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto
           my house: and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than
           it; or, if it seem good to thee, I will give thee the worth of
           it in money.

11:021:003 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should
           give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.

11:021:004 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of
           the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he
           had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers.
           And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face,
           and would eat no bread.

11:021:005 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is
           thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?

11:021:006 And he said unto her, Because I spake unto Naboth the
           Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money;
           or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard
           for it: and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.

11:021:007 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern the
           kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart
           be merry: I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the
           Jezreelite.

11:021:008 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with his
           seal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles
           that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.

11:021:009 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set
           Naboth on high among the people:

11:021:010 And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness
           against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king.
           And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.

11:021:011 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who
           were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto
           them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent
           unto them.

11:021:012 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the
           people.

11:021:013 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before
           him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against
           Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did
           blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of
           the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.

11:021:014 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is
           dead.

11:021:015 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was
           stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take
           possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he
           refused to give thee for money: for Naboth is not alive, but
           dead.

11:021:016 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead,
           that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the
           Jezreelite, to take possession of it.

11:021:017 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

11:021:018 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in
           Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he
           is gone down to possess it.

11:021:019 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD,
           Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt
           speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place
           where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy
           blood, even thine.

11:021:020 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? And
           he answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself
           to work evil in the sight of the LORD.

11:021:021 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thy
           posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against
           the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,

11:021:022 And will make thine house like the house of Jeroboam the son
           of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for
           the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger, and
           made Israel to sin.

11:021:023 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat
           Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.

11:021:024 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him
           that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.

11:021:025 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to
           work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his
           wife stirred up.

11:021:026 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to
           all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before
           the children of Israel.

11:021:027 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent
           his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and
           lay in sackcloth, and went softly.

11:021:028 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,

11:021:029 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because he
           humbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his
           days: but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his
           house.

11:022:001 And they continued three years without war between Syria and
           Israel.

11:022:002 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the
           king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.

11:022:003 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that
           Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out
           of the hand of the king of Syria?

11:022:004 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle
           to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I
           am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy
           horses.

11:022:005 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
           thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

11:022:006 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about
           four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against
           Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
           up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

11:022:007 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
           besides, that we might enquire of him?

11:022:008 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
           man, Micaiah the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the
           LORD: but I hate him; for he doth not prophesy good concerning
           me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.

11:022:009 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hasten
           hither Micaiah the son of Imlah.

11:022:010 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat
           each on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place
           in the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets
           prophesied before them.

11:022:011 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and
           he said, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the
           Syrians, until thou have consumed them.

11:022:012 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
           Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
           the king's hand.

11:022:013 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto
           him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare
           good unto the king with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee,
           be like the word of one of them, and speak that which is good.

11:022:014 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith unto
           me, that will I speak.

11:022:015 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,
           shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we
           forbear? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD
           shall deliver it into the hand of the king.

11:022:016 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee
           that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name
           of the LORD?

11:022:017 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as
           sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have
           no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.

11:022:018 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
           thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?

11:022:019 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw
           the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven
           standing by him on his right hand and on his left.

11:022:020 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go up
           and fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and
           another said on that manner.

11:022:021 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
           said, I will persuade him.

11:022:022 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will go
           forth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his
           prophets. And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail
           also: go forth, and do so.

11:022:023 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
           mouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
           concerning thee.

11:022:024 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiah
           on the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD
           from me to speak unto thee?

11:022:025 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day, when
           thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

11:022:026 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back
           unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
           son;

11:022:027 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
           and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
           affliction, until I come in peace.

11:022:028 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD
           hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every
           one of you.

11:022:029 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
           up to Ramothgilead.

11:022:030 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
           myself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.
           And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the
           battle.

11:022:031 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains
           that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with
           small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.

11:022:032 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
           Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel.
           And they turned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat
           cried out.

11:022:033 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots
           perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned
           back from pursuing him.

11:022:034 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
           of Israel between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said
           unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me
           out of the host; for I am wounded.

11:022:035 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up
           in his chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the
           blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.

11:022:036 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about the
           going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and
           every man to his own country.

11:022:037 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buried
           the king in Samaria.

11:022:038 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the
           dogs licked up his blood; and they washed his armour;
           according unto the word of the LORD which he spake.

11:022:039 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the
           ivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built,
           are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
           kings of Israel?

11:022:040 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned in
           his stead.

11:022:041 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in
           the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.

11:022:042 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to
           reign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And
           his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.

11:022:043 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned not
           aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the
           LORD: nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for
           the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.

11:022:044 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.

11:022:045 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he
           shewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of
           the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

11:022:046 And the remnant of the sodomites, which remained in the days
           of his father Asa, he took out of the land.

11:022:047 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.

11:022:048 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold:
           but they went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.

11:022:049 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let my
           servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat
           would not.

11:022:050 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
           his fathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his
           son reigned in his stead.

11:022:051 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria
           the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned
           two years over Israel.

11:022:052 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the
           way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the
           way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin:

11:022:053 For he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger
           the LORD God of Israel, according to all that his father had
           done.

Book 12        2 Kings

12:001:001 Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.

12:001:002 And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber
           that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and
           said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron
           whether I shall recover of this disease.

12:001:003 But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise,
           go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say
           unto them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel,
           that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?

12:001:004 Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down
           from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.
           And Elijah departed.

12:001:005 And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto
           them, Why are ye now turned back?

12:001:006 And they said unto him, There came a man up to meet us, and
           said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you, and
           say unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is
           not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub
           the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that
           bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

12:001:007 And he said unto them, What manner of man was he which came up
           to meet you, and told you these words?

12:001:008 And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a
           girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah
           the Tishbite.

12:001:009 Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty.
           And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an
           hill. And he spake unto him, Thou man of God, the king hath
           said, Come down.

12:001:010 And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be
           a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume
           thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and
           consumed him and his fifty.

12:001:011 Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his
           fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus
           hath the king said, Come down quickly.

12:001:012 And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I be a man of God,
           let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy
           fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed
           him and his fifty.

12:001:013 And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty.
           And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on
           his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said unto him,
           O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these
           fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight.

12:001:014 Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two
           captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore
           let my life now be precious in thy sight.

12:001:015 And the angel of the LORD said unto Elijah, Go down with him:
           be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him
           unto the king.

12:001:016 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou
           hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron,
           is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his
           word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which
           thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.

12:001:017 So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had
           spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of
           Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had
           no son.

12:001:018 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

12:002:001 And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into
           heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from
           Gilgal.

12:002:002 And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the
           LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said unto him, As the
           LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So
           they went down to Bethel.

12:002:003 And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to
           Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
           take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I
           know it; hold ye your peace.

12:002:004 And Elijah said unto him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for
           the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD
           liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they
           came to Jericho.

12:002:005 And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to
           Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the LORD will
           take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered,
           Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.

12:002:006 And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here; for the
           LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth,
           and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two
           went on.

12:002:007 And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to
           view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.

12:002:008 And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote
           the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that
           they two went over on dry ground.

12:002:009 And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah
           said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I be
           taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a
           double portion of thy spirit be upon me.

12:002:010 And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if
           thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto
           thee; but if not, it shall not be so.

12:002:011 And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that,
           behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire,
           and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a
           whirlwind into heaven.

12:002:012 And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the
           chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no
           more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in
           two pieces.

12:002:013 He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and
           went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;

12:002:014 And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote
           the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and
           when he also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and
           thither: and Elisha went over.

12:002:015 And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at
           Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on
           Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the
           ground before him.

12:002:016 And they said unto him, Behold now, there be with thy servants
           fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy
           master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD hath taken
           him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.
           And he said, Ye shall not send.

12:002:017 And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send.
           They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but
           found him not.

12:002:018 And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,)
           he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Go not?

12:002:019 And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee,
           the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but
           the water is naught, and the ground barren.

12:002:020 And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And
           they brought it to him.

12:002:021 And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast the
           salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed
           these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or
           barren land.

12:002:022 So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the
           saying of Elisha which he spake.

12:002:023 And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up
           by the way, there came forth little children out of the city,
           and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go
           up, thou bald head.

12:002:024 And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the
           name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of
           the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.

12:002:025 And he went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he
           returned to Samaria.

12:003:001 Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in
           Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and
           reigned twelve years.

12:003:002 And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his
           father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal
           that his father had made.

12:003:003 Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of
           Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

12:003:004 And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto
           the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred
           thousand rams, with the wool.

12:003:005 But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab
           rebelled against the king of Israel.

12:003:006 And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and
           numbered all Israel.

12:003:007 And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying,
           The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with
           me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as
           thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy
           horses.

12:003:008 And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The
           way through the wilderness of Edom.

12:003:009 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the
           king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days'
           journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the
           cattle that followed them.

12:003:010 And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called
           these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of
           Moab!

12:003:011 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD,
           that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of
           Israel's servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of
           Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.

12:003:012 And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the
           king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down
           to him.

12:003:013 And Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do
           with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the
           prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him,
           Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to
           deliver them into the hand of Moab.

12:003:014 And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
           stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of
           Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee,
           nor see thee.

12:003:015 But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the
           minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.

12:003:016 And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of
           ditches.

12:003:017 For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall
           ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that
           ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.

12:003:018 And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he
           will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.

12:003:019 And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city,
           and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water,
           and mar every good piece of land with stones.

12:003:020 And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was
           offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom,
           and the country was filled with water.

12:003:021 And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to
           fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on
           armour, and upward, and stood in the border.

12:003:022 And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon
           the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as
           red as blood:

12:003:023 And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and
           they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the
           spoil.

12:003:024 And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose
           up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but
           they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.

12:003:025 And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land
           cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all
           the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in
           Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers
           went about it, and smote it.

12:003:026 And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for
           him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to
           break through even unto the king of Edom: but they could not.

12:003:027 Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his
           stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And
           there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed
           from him, and returned to their own land.

12:004:001 Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of
           the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is
           dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and
           the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be
           bondmen.

12:004:002 And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me,
           what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath
           not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.

12:004:003 Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy
           neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.

12:004:004 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee
           and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels,
           and thou shalt set aside that which is full.

12:004:005 So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her
           sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.

12:004:006 And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said
           unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her,
           There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.

12:004:007 Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell
           the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of
           the rest.

12:004:008 And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was
           a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it
           was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat
           bread.

12:004:009 And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that
           this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually.

12:004:010 Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and
           let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and
           a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he
           shall turn in thither.

12:004:011 And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into
           the chamber, and lay there.

12:004:012 And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And
           when he had called her, she stood before him.

12:004:013 And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been
           careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for
           thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the
           captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own
           people.

12:004:014 And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi
           answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.

12:004:015 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood
           in the door.

12:004:016 And he said, About this season, according to the time of life,
           thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man
           of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid.

12:004:017 And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that
           Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.

12:004:018 And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went
           out to his father to the reapers.

12:004:019 And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to
           a lad, Carry him to his mother.

12:004:020 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he
           sat on her knees till noon, and then died.

12:004:021 And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God,
           and shut the door upon him, and went out.

12:004:022 And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray
           thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may
           run to the man of God, and come again.

12:004:023 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is
           neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.

12:004:024 Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and
           go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee.

12:004:025 So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And
           it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he
           said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:

12:004:026 Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it
           well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with
           the child? And she answered, It is well:

12:004:027 And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught
           him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And
           the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed
           within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not
           told me.

12:004:028 Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say,
           Do not deceive me?

12:004:029 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff
           in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute
           him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay
           my staff upon the face of the child.

12:004:030 And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as
           thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and
           followed her.

12:004:031 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the
           face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing.
           Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The
           child is not awaked.

12:004:032 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was
           dead, and laid upon his bed.

12:004:033 He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and
           prayed unto the LORD.

12:004:034 And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon
           his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his
           hands: and stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of
           the child waxed warm.

12:004:035 Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went
           up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed
           seven times, and the child opened his eyes.

12:004:036 And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he
           called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take
           up thy son.

12:004:037 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to
           the ground, and took up her son, and went out.

12:004:038 And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the
           land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him:
           and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe
           pottage for the sons of the prophets.

12:004:039 And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a
           wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and
           came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew
           them not.

12:004:040 So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as
           they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and
           said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they
           could not eat thereof.

12:004:041 But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and
           he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there
           was no harm in the pot.

12:004:042 And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of
           God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and
           full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto
           the people, that they may eat.

12:004:043 And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an
           hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may
           eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave
           thereof.

12:004:044 So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof,
           according to the word of the LORD.

12:005:001 Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a
           great man with his master, and honourable, because by him the
           LORD had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a mighty
           man in valour, but he was a leper.

12:005:002 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought
           away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid; and she
           waited on Naaman's wife.

12:005:003 And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord were with
           the prophet that is in Samaria! for he would recover him of
           his leprosy.

12:005:004 And one went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said
           the maid that is of the land of Israel.

12:005:005 And the king of Syria said, Go to, go, and I will send a
           letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with
           him ten talents of silver, and six thousand pieces of gold,
           and ten changes of raiment.

12:005:006 And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now
           when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith
           sent Naaman my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him
           of his leprosy.

12:005:007 And it came to pass, when the king of Israel had read the
           letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God, to kill
           and to make alive, that this man doth send unto me to recover
           a man of his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see
           how he seeketh a quarrel against me.

12:005:008 And it was so, when Elisha the man of God had heard that the
           king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king,
           saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? let him come now
           to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.

12:005:009 So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood
           at the door of the house of Elisha.

12:005:010 And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in
           Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee,
           and thou shalt be clean.

12:005:011 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said, Behold, I
           thought, He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on
           the name of the LORD his God, and strike his hand over the
           place, and recover the leper.

12:005:012 Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all
           the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, and be clean? So
           he turned and went away in a rage.

12:005:013 And his servants came near, and spake unto him, and said, My
           father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing,
           wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he
           saith to thee, Wash, and be clean?

12:005:014 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan,
           according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came
           again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.

12:005:015 And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and
           came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know
           that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now
           therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy servant.

12:005:016 But he said, As the LORD liveth, before whom I stand, I will
           receive none. And he urged him to take it; but he refused.

12:005:017 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given
           to thy servant two mules' burden of earth? for thy servant
           will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice
           unto other gods, but unto the LORD.

12:005:018 In this thing the LORD pardon thy servant, that when my master
           goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and he
           leaneth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon:
           when I bow down myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon
           thy servant in this thing.

12:005:019 And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a
           little way.

12:005:020 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said,
           Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not
           receiving at his hands that which he brought: but, as the LORD
           liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him.

12:005:021 So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him
           running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet
           him, and said, Is all well?

12:005:022 And he said, All is well. My master hath sent me, saying,
           Behold, even now there be come to me from mount Ephraim two
           young men of the sons of the prophets: give them, I pray thee,
           a talent of silver, and two changes of garments.

12:005:023 And Naaman said, Be content, take two talents. And he urged
           him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two
           changes of garments, and laid them upon two of his servants;
           and they bare them before him.

12:005:024 And when he came to the tower, he took them from their hand,
           and bestowed them in the house: and he let the men go, and
           they departed.

12:005:025 But he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said
           unto him, Whence comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant
           went no whither.

12:005:026 And he said unto him, Went not mine heart with thee, when the
           man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time
           to receive money, and to receive garments, and oliveyards, and
           vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and
           maidservants?

12:005:027 The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and
           unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a
           leper as white as snow.

12:006:001 And the sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the
           place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us.

12:006:002 Let us go, we pray thee, unto Jordan, and take thence every
           man a beam, and let us make us a place there, where we may
           dwell. And he answered, Go ye.

12:006:003 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy
           servants. And he answered, I will go.

12:006:004 So he went with them. And when they came to Jordan, they cut
           down wood.

12:006:005 But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the
           water: and he cried, and said, Alas, master! for it was
           borrowed.

12:006:006 And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he shewed him the
           place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and
           the iron did swim.

12:006:007 Therefore said he, Take it up to thee. And he put out his
           hand, and took it.

12:006:008 Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and took counsel
           with his servants, saying, In such and such a place shall be
           my camp.

12:006:009 And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying,
           Beware that thou pass not such a place; for thither the
           Syrians are come down.

12:006:010 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God
           told him and warned him of, and saved himself there, not once
           nor twice.

12:006:011 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for
           this thing; and he called his servants, and said unto them,
           Will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of Israel?

12:006:012 And one of his servants said, None, my lord, O king: but
           Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, telleth the king of
           Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.

12:006:013 And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and fetch
           him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.

12:006:014 Therefore sent he thither horses, and chariots, and a great
           host: and they came by night, and compassed the city about.

12:006:015 And when the servant of the man of God was risen early, and
           gone forth, behold, an host compassed the city both with
           horses and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my
           master! how shall we do?

12:006:016 And he answered, Fear not: for they that be with us are more
           than they that be with them.

12:006:017 And Elisha prayed, and said, LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes,
           that he may see. And the LORD opened the eyes of the young
           man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses
           and chariots of fire round about Elisha.

12:006:018 And when they came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the LORD,
           and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindness. And
           he smote them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.

12:006:019 And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is
           this the city: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom
           ye seek. But he led them to Samaria.

12:006:020 And it came to pass, when they were come into Samaria, that
           Elisha said, LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may
           see. And the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and,
           behold, they were in the midst of Samaria.

12:006:021 And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My
           father, shall I smite them? shall I smite them?

12:006:022 And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them: wouldest thou
           smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and
           with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may
           eat and drink, and go to their master.

12:006:023 And he prepared great provision for them: and when they had
           eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their
           master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of
           Israel.

12:006:024 And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria
           gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.

12:006:025 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and, behold, they
           besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces
           of silver, and the fourth part of a cab of dove's dung for
           five pieces of silver.

12:006:026 And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, there
           cried a woman unto him, saying, Help, my lord, O king.

12:006:027 And he said, If the LORD do not help thee, whence shall I help
           thee? out of the barnfloor, or out of the winepress?

12:006:028 And the king said unto her, What aileth thee? And she
           answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son, that we may
           eat him to day, and we will eat my son to morrow.

12:006:029 So we boiled my son, and did eat him: and I said unto her on
           the next day, Give thy son, that we may eat him: and she hath
           hid her son.

12:006:030 And it came to pass, when the king heard the words of the
           woman, that he rent his clothes; and he passed by upon the
           wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth
           within upon his flesh.

12:006:031 Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of
           Elisha the son of Shaphat shall stand on him this day.

12:006:032 But Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and
           the king sent a man from before him: but ere the messenger
           came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a
           murderer hath sent to take away mine head? look, when the
           messenger cometh, shut the door, and hold him fast at the
           door: is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?

12:006:033 And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came
           down unto him: and he said, Behold, this evil is of the LORD;
           what should I wait for the LORD any longer?

12:007:001 Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the
           LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour
           be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel,
           in the gate of Samaria.

12:007:002 Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of
           God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in
           heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt
           see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof.

12:007:003 And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the
           gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we
           die?

12:007:004 If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in
           the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we
           die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of
           the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they
           kill us, we shall but die.

12:007:005 And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the
           Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the
           camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.

12:007:006 For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise
           of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great
           host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel
           hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings
           of the Egyptians, to come upon us.

12:007:007 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their
           tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it
           was, and fled for their life.

12:007:008 And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp,
           they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried
           thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and
           came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence
           also, and went and hid it.

12:007:009 Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a
           day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till
           the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now
           therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household.

12:007:010 So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they
           told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and,
           behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but
           horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were.

12:007:011 And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's
           house within.

12:007:012 And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I
           will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know
           that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to
           hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of
           the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.

12:007:013 And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I
           pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in
           the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel
           that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the
           multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us
           send and see.

12:007:014 They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent
           after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.

12:007:015 And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was
           full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away
           in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the
           king.

12:007:016 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians.
           So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two
           measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the
           LORD.

12:007:017 And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to
           have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in
           the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake
           when the king came down to him.

12:007:018 And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king,
           saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of
           fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in
           the gate of Samaria:

12:007:019 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold,
           if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing
           be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes,
           but shalt not eat thereof.

12:007:020 And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in
           the gate, and he died.

12:008:001 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to
           life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and
           sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath
           called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land
           seven years.

12:008:002 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of
           God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the
           land of the Philistines seven years.

12:008:003 And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman
           returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went
           forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land.

12:008:004 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
           saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha
           hath done.

12:008:005 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
           restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose
           son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house
           and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is
           the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.

12:008:006 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
           appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that
           was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that
           she left the land, even until now.

12:008:007 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria
           was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come
           hither.

12:008:008 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand,
           and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him,
           saying, Shall I recover of this disease?

12:008:009 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even
           of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels' burden, and
           came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of
           Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this
           disease?

12:008:010 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest
           certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he
           shall surely die.

12:008:011 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was
           ashamed: and the man of God wept.

12:008:012 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because
           I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel:
           their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men
           wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children,
           and rip up their women with child.

12:008:013 And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he
           should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath
           shewed me that thou shalt be king over Syria.

12:008:014 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said
           to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me
           that thou shouldest surely recover.

12:008:015 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
           and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he
           died: and Hazael reigned in his stead.

12:008:016 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
           Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je
           hoshaphat king of Judah began to reign.

12:008:017 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
           reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

12:008:018 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the
           house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he
           did evil in the sight of the LORD.

12:008:019 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant's
           sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his
           children.

12:008:020 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and
           made a king over themselves.

12:008:021 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and
           he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him
           about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled
           into their tents.

12:008:022 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
           Then Libnah revolted at the same time.

12:008:023 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

12:008:024 And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
           fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in
           his stead.

12:008:025 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel
           did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.

12:008:026 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign;
           and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
           was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of Israel.

12:008:027 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in
           the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was
           the son in law of the house of Ahab.

12:008:028 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against
           Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded
           Joram.

12:008:029 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
           which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought
           against Hazael king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram
           king of Judah went down to see Joram the son of Ahab in
           Jezreel, because he was sick.

12:009:001 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the
           prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this
           box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:

12:009:002 And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
           Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise
           up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;

12:009:003 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say,
           Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel.
           Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.

12:009:004 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
           Ramothgilead.

12:009:005 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were
           sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And
           Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O
           captain.

12:009:006 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil
           on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
           Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD,
           even over Israel.

12:009:007 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
           avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of
           all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.

12:009:008 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off
           from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is
           shut up and left in Israel:

12:009:009 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam
           the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of
           Ahijah:

12:009:010 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and
           there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and
           fled.

12:009:011 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said
           unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee?
           And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.

12:009:012 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and
           thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have
           anointed thee king over Israel.

12:009:013 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it
           under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets,
           saying, Jehu is king.

12:009:014 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
           against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all
           Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.

12:009:015 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the
           wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with
           Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds,
           then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to
           tell it in Jezreel.

12:009:016 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay
           there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.

12:009:017 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he
           spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a
           company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet
           them, and let him say, Is it peace?

12:009:018 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus
           saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to
           do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told,
           saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again.

12:009:019 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them,
           and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered,
           What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.

12:009:020 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and
           cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu
           the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.

12:009:021 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready.
           And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out,
           each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met
           him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.

12:009:022 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
           peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the
           whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so
           many?

12:009:023 And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah,
           There is treachery, O Ahaziah.

12:009:024 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
           between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he
           sunk down in his chariot.

12:009:025 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in
           the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for
           remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab
           his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him;

12:009:026 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the
           blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in
           this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him
           into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.

12:009:027 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the
           way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and
           said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the
           going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo,
           and died there.

12:009:028 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
           buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of
           David.

12:009:029 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began
           Ahaziah to reign over Judah.

12:009:030 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and
           she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a
           window.

12:009:031 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,
           who slew his master?

12:009:032 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on
           my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three
           eunuchs.

12:009:033 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some
           of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and
           he trode her under foot.

12:009:034 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go,
           see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's
           daughter.

12:009:035 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than
           the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.

12:009:036 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is
           the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the
           Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the
           flesh of Jezebel:

12:009:037 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of
           the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not
           say, This is Jezebel.

12:010:001 And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters,
           and sent to Samaria, unto the rulers of Jezreel, to the
           elders, and to them that brought up Ahab's children, saying,

12:010:002 Now as soon as this letter cometh to you, seeing your master's
           sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses,
           a fenced city also, and armour;

12:010:003 Look even out the best and meetest of your master's sons, and
           set him on his father's throne, and fight for your master's
           house.

12:010:004 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings
           stood not before him: how then shall we stand?

12:010:005 And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city,
           the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to
           Jehu, saying, We are thy servants, and will do all that thou
           shalt bid us; we will not make any king: do thou that which is
           good in thine eyes.

12:010:006 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye
           be mine, and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take ye the
           heads of the men your master's sons, and come to me to Jezreel
           by to morrow this time. Now the king's sons, being seventy
           persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought
           them up.

12:010:007 And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they
           took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their
           heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.

12:010:008 And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have
           brought the heads of the king's sons. And he said, Lay ye them
           in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.

12:010:009 And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and
           stood, and said to all the people, Ye be righteous: behold, I
           conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all
           these?

12:010:010 Know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the
           word of the LORD, which the LORD spake concerning the house of
           Ahab: for the LORD hath done that which he spake by his
           servant Elijah.

12:010:011 So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in
           Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his
           priests, until he left him none remaining.

12:010:012 And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was
           at the shearing house in the way,

12:010:013 Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said,
           Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah;
           and we go down to salute the children of the king and the
           children of the queen.

12:010:014 And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and
           slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty
           men; neither left he any of them.

12:010:015 And when he was departed thence, he lighted on Jehonadab the
           son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said
           to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart?
           And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me thine hand.
           And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the
           chariot.

12:010:016 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So
           they made him ride in his chariot.

12:010:017 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained unto
           Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the
           saying of the LORD, which he spake to Elijah.

12:010:018 And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said unto them,
           Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.

12:010:019 Now therefore call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his
           servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have
           a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whosoever shall be wanting,
           he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty, to the intent
           that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.

12:010:020 And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they
           proclaimed it.

12:010:021 And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of
           Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And
           they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was
           full from one end to another.

12:010:022 And he said unto him that was over the vestry, Bring forth
           vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them
           forth vestments.

12:010:023 And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house
           of Baal, and said unto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and
           look that there be here with you none of the servants of the
           LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.

12:010:024 And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings,
           Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the
           men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that
           letteth him go, his life shall be for the life of him.

12:010:025 And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering
           the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the
           captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they
           smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the
           captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of
           Baal.

12:010:026 And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal,
           and burned them.

12:010:027 And they brake down the image of Baal, and brake down the
           house of Baal, and made it a draught house unto this day.

12:010:028 Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.

12:010:029 Howbeit from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
           Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the
           golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.

12:010:030 And the LORD said unto Jehu, Because thou hast done well in
           executing that which is right in mine eyes, and hast done unto
           the house of Ahab according to all that was in mine heart, thy
           children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of
           Israel.

12:010:031 But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of
           Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins
           of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.

12:010:032 In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael
           smote them in all the coasts of Israel;

12:010:033 From Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and
           the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, which is by
           the river Arnon, even Gilead and Bashan.

12:010:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehu, and all that he did, and all
           his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
           of the kings of Israel?

12:010:035 And Jehu slept with his fathers: and they buried him in
           Samaria. And Jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead.

12:010:036 And the time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was
           twenty and eight years.

12:011:001 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
           dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.

12:011:002 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
           took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the
           king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and
           his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not
           slain.

12:011:003 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years.
           And Athaliah did reign over the land.

12:011:004 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
           hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to
           him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them,
           and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed
           them the king's son.

12:011:005 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall
           do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall
           even be keepers of the watch of the king's house;

12:011:006 And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part
           at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of
           the house, that it be not broken down.

12:011:007 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even
           they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the
           king.

12:011:008 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his
           weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let
           him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as
           he cometh in.

12:011:009 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
           that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man
           his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that
           should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.

12:011:010 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
           David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the
           LORD.

12:011:011 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
           round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to
           the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the
           temple.

12:011:012 And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon
           him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and
           anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save
           the king.

12:011:013 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
           people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.

12:011:014 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as
           the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the
           king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with
           trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason,
           Treason.

12:011:015 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the
           hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have
           her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill
           with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain
           in the house of the LORD.

12:011:016 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the
           which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she
           slain.

12:011:017 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
           the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the
           king also and the people.

12:011:018 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal,
           and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in
           pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before
           the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house
           of the LORD.

12:011:019 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and
           the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought
           down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way
           of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on
           the throne of the kings.

12:011:020 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
           quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's
           house.

12:011:021 Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.

12:012:001 In the seventh year of Jehu Jehoash began to reign; and forty
           years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
           Zibiah of Beersheba.

12:012:002 And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
           all his days wherein Jehoiada the priest instructed him.

12:012:003 But the high places were not taken away: the people still
           sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.

12:012:004 And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the
           dedicated things that is brought into the house of the LORD,
           even the money of every one that passeth the account, the
           money that every man is set at, and all the money that cometh
           into any man's heart to bring into the house of the LORD,

12:012:005 Let the priests take it to them, every man of his
           acquaintance: and let them repair the breaches of the house,
           wheresoever any breach shall be found.

12:012:006 But it was so, that in the three and twentieth year of king
           Jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the
           house.

12:012:007 Then king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, and the
           other priests, and said unto them, Why repair ye not the
           breaches of the house? now therefore receive no more money of
           your acquaintance, but deliver it for the breaches of the
           house.

12:012:008 And the priests consented to receive no more money of the
           people, neither to repair the breaches of the house.

12:012:009 But Jehoiada the priest took a chest, and bored a hole in the
           lid of it, and set it beside the altar, on the right side as
           one cometh into the house of the LORD: and the priests that
           kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into
           the house of the LORD.

12:012:010 And it was so, when they saw that there was much money in the
           chest, that the king's scribe and the high priest came up, and
           they put up in bags, and told the money that was found in the
           house of the LORD.

12:012:011 And they gave the money, being told, into the hands of them
           that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the
           LORD: and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders,
           that wrought upon the house of the LORD,

12:012:012 And to masons, and hewers of stone, and to buy timber and
           hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the LORD,
           and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it.

12:012:013 Howbeit there were not made for the house of the LORD bowls of
           silver, snuffers, basons, trumpets, any vessels of gold, or
           vessels of silver, of the money that was brought into the
           house of the LORD:

12:012:014 But they gave that to the workmen, and repaired therewith the
           house of the LORD.

12:012:015 Moreover they reckoned not with the men, into whose hand they
           delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen: for they dealt
           faithfully.

12:012:016 The trespass money and sin money was not brought into the
           house of the LORD: it was the priests'.

12:012:017 Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath,
           and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem.

12:012:018 And Jehoash king of Judah took all the hallowed things that
           Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of
           Judah, had dedicated, and his own hallowed things, and all the
           gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the LORD,
           and in the king's house, and sent it to Hazael king of Syria:
           and he went away from Jerusalem.

12:012:019 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

12:012:020 And his servants arose, and made a conspiracy, and slew Joash
           in the house of Millo, which goeth down to Silla.

12:012:021 For Jozachar the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad the son of
           Shomer, his servants, smote him, and he died; and they buried
           him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son
           reigned in his stead.

12:013:001 In the three and twentieth year of Joash the son of Ahaziah
           king of Judah Jehoahaz the son of Jehu began to reign over
           Israel in Samaria, and reigned seventeen years.

12:013:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, and
           followed the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made
           Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.

12:013:003 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he
           delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into
           the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days.

12:013:004 And Jehoahaz besought the LORD, and the LORD hearkened unto
           him: for he saw the oppression of Israel, because the king of
           Syria oppressed them.

12:013:005 (And the LORD gave Israel a saviour, so that they went out
           from under the hand of the Syrians: and the children of Israel
           dwelt in their tents, as beforetime.

12:013:006 Nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of
           Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked therein: and there
           remained the grove also in Samaria.)

12:013:007 Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty
           horsemen, and ten chariots, and ten thousand footmen; for the
           king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the
           dust by threshing.

12:013:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz, and all that he did, and
           his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles
           of the kings of Israel?

12:013:009 And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers; and they buried him in
           Samaria: and Joash his son reigned in his stead.

12:013:010 In the thirty and seventh year of Joash king of Judah began
           Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz to reign over Israel in Samaria,
           and reigned sixteen years.

12:013:011 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD; he
           departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
           who made Israel sin: but he walked therein.

12:013:012 And the rest of the acts of Joash, and all that he did, and
           his might wherewith he fought against Amaziah king of Judah,
           are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
           kings of Israel?

12:013:013 And Joash slept with his fathers; and Jeroboam sat upon his
           throne: and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of
           Israel.

12:013:014 Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died.
           And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over
           his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariot of
           Israel, and the horsemen thereof.

12:013:015 And Elisha said unto him, Take bow and arrows. And he took
           unto him bow and arrows.

12:013:016 And he said to the king of Israel, Put thine hand upon the
           bow. And he put his hand upon it: and Elisha put his hands
           upon the king's hands.

12:013:017 And he said, Open the window eastward. And he opened it. Then
           Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the
           LORD's deliverance, and the arrow of deliverance from Syria:
           for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou have
           consumed them.

12:013:018 And he said, Take the arrows. And he took them. And he said
           unto the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote
           thrice, and stayed.

12:013:019 And the man of God was wroth with him, and said, Thou
           shouldest have smitten five or six times; then hadst thou
           smitten Syria till thou hadst consumed it: whereas now thou
           shalt smite Syria but thrice.

12:013:020 And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the
           Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.

12:013:021 And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold,
           they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the
           sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man was let down, and
           touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his
           feet.

12:013:022 But Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of
           Jehoahaz.

12:013:023 And the LORD was gracious unto them, and had compassion on
           them, and had respect unto them, because of his covenant with
           Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and would not destroy them, neither
           cast he them from his presence as yet.

12:013:024 So Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in
           his stead.

12:013:025 And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of
           Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out
           of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did
           Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.

12:014:001 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel
           reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.

12:014:002 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
           reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

12:014:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet
           not like David his father: he did according to all things as
           Joash his father did.

12:014:004 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
           did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.

12:014:005 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in
           his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king
           his father.

12:014:006 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto
           that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein
           the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to
           death for the children, nor the children be put to death for
           the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own
           sin.

12:014:007 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
           Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this
           day.

12:014:008 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz
           son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one
           another in the face.

12:014:009 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
           saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
           was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
           and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
           trode down the thistle.

12:014:010 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted
           thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest
           thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou,
           and Judah with thee?

12:014:011 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
           went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another
           in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

12:014:012 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
           every man to their tents.

12:014:013 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
           of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to
           Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate
           of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

12:014:014 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
           were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of
           the king's house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.

12:014:015 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his
           might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they
           not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Israel?

12:014:016 And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria
           with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his
           stead.

12:014:017 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
           death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

12:014:018 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in
           the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

12:014:019 Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he
           fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew
           him there.

12:014:020 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem
           with his fathers in the city of David.

12:014:021 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen
           years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.

12:014:022 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
           slept with his fathers.

12:014:023 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of
           Judah Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign
           in Samaria, and reigned forty and one years.

12:014:024 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
           departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
           who made Israel to sin.

12:014:025 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath
           unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD
           God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant
           Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of
           Gathhepher.

12:014:026 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very
           bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any
           helper for Israel.

12:014:027 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of
           Israel from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of
           Jeroboam the son of Joash.

12:014:028 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and
           his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and
           Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?

12:014:029 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of
           Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.

12:015:001 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel
           began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.

12:015:002 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he
           reigned two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.

12:015:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his father Amaziah had done;

12:015:004 Save that the high places were not removed: the people
           sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.

12:015:005 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the
           day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the
           king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land.

12:015:006 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

12:015:007 So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with
           his fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned
           in his stead.

12:015:008 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did
           Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six
           months.

12:015:009 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
           his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of
           Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

12:015:010 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote
           him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.

12:015:011 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.

12:015:012 This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu,
           saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the
           fourth generation. And so it came to pass.

12:015:013 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
           thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full
           month in Samaria.

12:015:014 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
           Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and
           slew him, and reigned in his stead.

12:015:015 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which
           he made, behold, they are written in the book of the
           chronicles of the kings of Israel.

12:015:016 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
           coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him,
           therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were
           with child he ripped up.

12:015:017 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
           Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten
           years in Samaria.

12:015:018 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
           departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
           Nebat, who made Israel to sin.

12:015:019 And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem
           gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be
           with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.

12:015:020 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the
           mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to
           give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned
           back, and stayed not there in the land.

12:015:021 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Israel?

12:015:022 And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son
           reigned in his stead.

12:015:023 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son
           of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned
           two years.

12:015:024 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
           departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
           made Israel to sin.

12:015:025 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
           against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the
           king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of
           the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room.

12:015:026 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
           behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
           kings of Israel.

12:015:027 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah
           the son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and
           reigned twenty years.

12:015:028 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
           departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who
           made Israel to sin.

12:015:029 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king
           of Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah,
           and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land
           of Naphtali, and carried them captive to Assyria.

12:015:030 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the
           son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in
           his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.

12:015:031 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did,
           behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
           kings of Israel.

12:015:032 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel
           began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.

12:015:033 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and
           he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name
           was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.

12:015:034 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he
           did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.

12:015:035 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people
           sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He
           built the higher gate of the house of the LORD.

12:015:036 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

12:015:037 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the
           king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.

12:015:038 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
           fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son
           reigned in his stead.

12:016:001 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the
           son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

12:016:002 Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned
           sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right
           in the sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.

12:016:003 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made
           his son to pass through the fire, according to the
           abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from
           before the children of Israel.

12:016:004 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
           the hills, and under every green tree.

12:016:005 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of
           Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz,
           but could not overcome him.

12:016:006 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and
           drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and
           dwelt there unto this day.

12:016:007 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
           saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out
           of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the
           king of Israel, which rise up against me.

12:016:008 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house
           of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and
           sent it for a present to the king of Assyria.

12:016:009 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
           Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the
           people of it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

12:016:010 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
           Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz
           sent to Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the
           pattern of it, according to all the workmanship thereof.

12:016:011 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that
           king Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it
           against king Ahaz came from Damascus.

12:016:012 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the
           altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered
           thereon.

12:016:013 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and
           poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his
           peace offerings, upon the altar.

12:016:014 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the
           LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar
           and the house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the
           altar.

12:016:015 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the
           great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening
           meat offering, and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat
           offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the
           land, and their meat offering, and their drink offerings; and
           sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all
           the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for
           me to enquire by.

12:016:016 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
           commanded.

12:016:017 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed
           the laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the
           brasen oxen that were under it, and put it upon the pavement
           of stones.

12:016:018 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the
           house, and the king's entry without, turned he from the house
           of the LORD for the king of Assyria.

12:016:019 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

12:016:020 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
           fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in
           his stead.

12:017:001 In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son
           of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.

12:017:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but
           not as the kings of Israel that were before him.

12:017:003 Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea
           became his servant, and gave him presents.

12:017:004 And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had
           sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to
           the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore
           the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison.

12:017:005 Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and
           went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years.

12:017:006 In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria,
           and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah
           and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the
           Medes.

12:017:007 For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against
           the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land
           of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
           had feared other gods,

12:017:008 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast
           out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of
           Israel, which they had made.

12:017:009 And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were
           not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high
           places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to
           the fenced city.

12:017:010 And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and
           under every green tree:

12:017:011 And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did
           the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and
           wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger:

12:017:012 For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye
           shall not do this thing.

12:017:013 Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by
           all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from
           your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes,
           according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and
           which I sent to you by my servants the prophets.

12:017:014 Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks,
           like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the
           LORD their God.

12:017:015 And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made
           with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified
           against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and
           went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning
           whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like
           them.

12:017:016 And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and
           made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove,
           and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal.

12:017:017 And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through
           the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold
           themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him
           to anger.

12:017:018 Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed
           them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of
           Judah only.

12:017:019 Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God,
           but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made.

12:017:020 And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted
           them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he
           had cast them out of his sight.

12:017:021 For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made
           Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from
           following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin.

12:017:022 For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam
           which he did; they departed not from them;

12:017:023 Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said
           by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away
           out of their own land to Assyria unto this day.

12:017:024 And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from
           Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim,
           and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the
           children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in
           the cities thereof.

12:017:025 And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that
           they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among
           them, which slew some of them.

12:017:026 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The
           nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of
           Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore
           he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them,
           because they know not the manner of the God of the land.

12:017:027 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one
           of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go
           and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God
           of the land.

12:017:028 Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from
           Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they
           should fear the LORD.

12:017:029 Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in
           the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made,
           every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt.

12:017:030 And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth
           made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,

12:017:031 And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites
           burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech,
           the gods of Sepharvaim.

12:017:032 So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the
           lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed
           for them in the houses of the high places.

12:017:033 They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the
           manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence.

12:017:034 Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not
           the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their
           ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD
           commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;

12:017:035 With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them,
           saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to
           them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them:

12:017:036 But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with
           great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and
           him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice.

12:017:037 And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the
           commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do
           for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods.

12:017:038 And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not
           forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.

12:017:039 But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you
           out of the hand of all your enemies.

12:017:040 Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former
           manner.

12:017:041 So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven
           images, both their children, and their children's children: as
           did their fathers, so do they unto this day.

12:018:001 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of Elah
           king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah
           began to reign.

12:018:002 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and
           he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother's
           name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.

12:018:003 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that David his father did.

12:018:004 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down
           the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses
           had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn
           incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan.

12:018:005 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was
           none like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were
           before him.

12:018:006 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,
           but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.

12:018:007 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he
           went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and
           served him not.

12:018:008 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders
           thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.

12:018:009 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
           was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel,
           that Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and
           besieged it.

12:018:010 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth
           year of Hezekiah, that is in the ninth year of Hoshea king of
           Israel, Samaria was taken.

12:018:011 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria,
           and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and
           in the cities of the Medes:

12:018:012 Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but
           transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of
           the LORD commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.

12:018:013 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib
           king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of
           Judah, and took them.

12:018:014 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
           Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which
           thou puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria
           appointed unto Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of
           silver and thirty talents of gold.

12:018:015 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the
           house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house.

12:018:016 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of
           the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah
           king of Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of
           Assyria.

12:018:017 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
           from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against
           Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when
           they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the
           upper pool, which is in the highway of the fuller's field.

12:018:018 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them
           Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and
           Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.

12:018:019 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
           saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
           this wherein thou trustest?

12:018:020 Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and
           strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou
           rebellest against me?

12:018:021 Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised
           reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into
           his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all
           that trust on him.

12:018:022 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not
           that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath
           taken away, and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall
           worship before this altar in Jerusalem?

12:018:023 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king
           of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if
           thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

12:018:024 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
           least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
           chariots and for horsemen?

12:018:025 Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to
           destroy it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and
           destroy it.

12:018:026 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah,
           unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the
           Syrian language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in
           the Jews' language in the ears of the people that are on the
           wall.

12:018:027 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
           master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me
           to the men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own
           dung, and drink their own piss with you?

12:018:028 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
           language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king,
           the king of Assyria:

12:018:029 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
           shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand:

12:018:030 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
           LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be
           delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

12:018:031 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
           Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me,
           and then eat ye every man of his own vine, and every one of
           his fig tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his
           cistern:

12:018:032 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
           land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land
           of oil olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and
           hearken not unto Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The
           LORD will deliver us.

12:018:033 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
           out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

12:018:034 Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods
           of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out
           of mine hand?

12:018:035 Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have
           delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should
           deliver Jerusalem out of mine hand?

12:018:036 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word:
           for the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

12:018:037 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
           household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph
           the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told
           him the words of Rabshakeh.

12:019:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
           his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
           the house of the LORD.

12:019:002 And he sent Eliakim, which was over the household, and Shebna
           the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with
           sackcloth, to Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

12:019:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
           of trouble, and of rebuke, and blasphemy; for the children are
           come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.

12:019:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear all the words of
           Rabshakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to
           reproach the living God; and will reprove the words which the
           LORD thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the
           remnant that are left.

12:019:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

12:019:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master,
           Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words which thou
           hast heard, with which the servants of the king of Assyria
           have blasphemed me.

12:019:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
           rumour, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him
           to fall by the sword in his own land.

12:019:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
           against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
           Lachish.

12:019:009 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, he
           is come out to fight against thee: he sent messengers again
           unto Hezekiah, saying,

12:019:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not
           thy God in whom thou trustest deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem
           shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.

12:019:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
           all lands, by destroying them utterly: and shalt thou be
           delivered?

12:019:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
           have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
           children of Eden which were in Thelasar?

12:019:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the
           king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?

12:019:014 And Hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the
           messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up into the house
           of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

12:019:015 And Hezekiah prayed before the LORD, and said, O LORD God of
           Israel, which dwellest between the cherubims, thou art the
           God, even thou alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth; thou
           hast made heaven and earth.

12:019:016 LORD, bow down thine ear, and hear: open, LORD, thine eyes,
           and see: and hear the words of Sennacherib, which hath sent
           him to reproach the living God.

12:019:017 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have destroyed the
           nations and their lands,

12:019:018 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods,
           but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
           have destroyed them.

12:019:019 Now therefore, O LORD our God, I beseech thee, save thou us
           out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know
           that thou art the LORD God, even thou only.

12:019:020 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus
           saith the LORD God of Israel, That which thou hast prayed to
           me against Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard.

12:019:021 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning him; The
           virgin the daughter of Zion hath despised thee, and laughed
           thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head
           at thee.

12:019:022 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
           hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
           even against the Holy One of Israel.

12:019:023 By thy messengers thou hast reproached the LORD, and hast
           said, With the multitude of my chariots I am come up to the
           height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut
           down the tall cedar trees thereof, and the choice fir trees
           thereof: and I will enter into the lodgings of his borders,
           and into the forest of his Carmel.

12:019:024 I have digged and drunk strange waters, and with the sole of
           my feet have I dried up all the rivers of besieged places.

12:019:025 Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it, and of
           ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
           pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into
           ruinous heaps.

12:019:026 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
           dismayed and confounded; they were as the grass of the field,
           and as the green herb, as the grass on the house tops, and as
           corn blasted before it be grown up.

12:019:027 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
           and thy rage against me.

12:019:028 Because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into
           mine ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose, and my
           bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
           which thou camest.

12:019:029 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year
           such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year that
           which springeth of the same; and in the third year sow ye, and
           reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruits thereof.

12:019:030 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
           yet again take root downward, and bear fruit upward.

12:019:031 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
           escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall
           do this.

12:019:032 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
           He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
           nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.

12:019:033 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
           shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

12:019:034 For I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake,
           and for my servant David's sake.

12:019:035 And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD
           went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred
           fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the
           morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.

12:019:036 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
           returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

12:019:037 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
           Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
           him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of Armenia.
           And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

12:020:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And the prophet
           Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus
           saith the LORD, Set thine house in order; for thou shalt die,
           and not live.

12:020:002 Then he turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
           saying,

12:020:003 I beseech thee, O LORD, remember now how I have walked before
           thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that
           which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

12:020:004 And it came to pass, afore Isaiah was gone out into the middle
           court, that the word of the LORD came to him, saying,

12:020:005 Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus
           saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy
           prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on
           the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.

12:020:006 And I will add unto thy days fifteen years; and I will deliver
           thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and
           I will defend this city for mine own sake, and for my servant
           David's sake.

12:020:007 And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid
           it on the boil, and he recovered.

12:020:008 And Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the
           LORD will heal me, and that I shall go up into the house of
           the LORD the third day?

12:020:009 And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the LORD, that
           the LORD will do the thing that he hath spoken: shall the
           shadow go forward ten degrees, or go back ten degrees?

12:020:010 And Hezekiah answered, It is a light thing for the shadow to
           go down ten degrees: nay, but let the shadow return backward
           ten degrees.

12:020:011 And Isaiah the prophet cried unto the LORD: and he brought the
           shadow ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the
           dial of Ahaz.

12:020:012 At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
           Babylon, sent letters and a present unto Hezekiah: for he had
           heard that Hezekiah had been sick.

12:020:013 And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all the
           house of his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and
           the spices, and the precious ointment, and all the house of
           his armour, and all that was found in his treasures: there was
           nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah
           shewed them not.

12:020:014 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
           him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
           And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country, even from
           Babylon.

12:020:015 And he said, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
           answered, All the things that are in mine house have they
           seen: there is nothing among my treasures that I have not
           shewed them.

12:020:016 And Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD.

12:020:017 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and
           that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day,
           shall be carried into Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith
           the LORD.

12:020:018 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
           beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
           palace of the king of Babylon.

12:020:019 Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
           which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace
           and truth be in my days?

12:020:020 And the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and all his might, and
           how he made a pool, and a conduit, and brought water into the
           city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of
           the kings of Judah?

12:020:021 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers: and Manasseh his son
           reigned in his stead.

12:021:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and
           reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Hephzibah.

12:021:002 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after
           the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before
           the children of Israel.

12:021:003 For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his
           father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and
           made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all
           the host of heaven, and served them.

12:021:004 And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the
           LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.

12:021:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
           courts of the house of the LORD.

12:021:006 And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times,
           and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and
           wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD,
           to provoke him to anger.

12:021:007 And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the
           house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his
           son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out
           of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

12:021:008 Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of
           the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe
           to do according to all that I have commanded them, and
           according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.

12:021:009 But they hearkened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more
           evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the
           children of Israel.

12:021:010 And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying,

12:021:011 Because Manasseh king of Judah hath done these abominations,
           and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which
           were before him, and hath made Judah also to sin with his
           idols:

12:021:012 Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am
           bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whosoever
           heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle.

12:021:013 And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the
           plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a
           man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.

12:021:014 And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and
           deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall
           become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;

12:021:015 Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and
           have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came
           forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.

12:021:016 Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had
           filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin
           wherewith he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil
           in the sight of the LORD.

12:021:017 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and
           his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of
           the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

12:021:018 And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
           garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his
           son reigned in his stead.

12:021:019 Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and
           he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was
           Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.

12:021:020 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
           his father Manasseh did.

12:021:021 And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and
           served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:

12:021:022 And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in
           the way of the LORD.

12:021:023 And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the
           king in his own house.

12:021:024 And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
           against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
           son king in his stead.

12:021:025 Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not
           written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

12:021:026 And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and
           Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

12:022:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.

12:022:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
           walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not
           aside to the right hand or to the left.

12:022:003 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah,
           that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of
           Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,

12:022:004 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver
           which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers
           of the door have gathered of the people:

12:022:005 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the
           work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and
           let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the
           house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,

12:022:006 Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber
           and hewn stone to repair the house.

12:022:007 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money
           that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt
           faithfully.

12:022:008 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I
           have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
           Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.

12:022:009 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
           word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money
           that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the
           hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the
           house of the LORD.

12:022:010 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the
           priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before
           the king.

12:022:011 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
           book of the law, that he rent his clothes.

12:022:012 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son
           of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the
           scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king's, saying,

12:022:013 Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for
           all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found:
           for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us,
           because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this
           book, to do according unto all that which is written
           concerning us.

12:022:014 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan,
           and Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of
           Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the
           wardrobe; (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the college;) and
           they communed with her.

12:022:015 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel,
           Tell the man that sent you to me,

12:022:016 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
           place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of
           the book which the king of Judah hath read:

12:022:017 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
           other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
           works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled
           against this place, and shall not be quenched.

12:022:018 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the
           LORD, thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of
           Israel, As touching the words which thou hast heard;

12:022:019 Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself
           before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this
           place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should
           become a desolation and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes,
           and wept before me; I also have heard thee, saith the LORD.

12:022:020 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and
           thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes
           shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place.
           And they brought the king word again.

12:023:001 And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders
           of Judah and of Jerusalem.

12:023:002 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
           men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him,
           and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both
           small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of
           the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the
           LORD.

12:023:003 And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the
           LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and
           his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all
           their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were
           written in this book. And all the people stood to the
           covenant.

12:023:004 And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the
           priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to
           bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that
           were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of
           heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of
           Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel.

12:023:005 And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of
           Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the
           cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them
           also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the
           moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.

12:023:006 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD,
           without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the
           brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the
           powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.

12:023:007 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by
           the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the
           grove.

12:023:008 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and
           defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense,
           from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the
           gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the
           governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the
           gate of the city.

12:023:009 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
           altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the
           unleavened bread among their brethren.

12:023:010 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children
           of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to
           pass through the fire to Molech.

12:023:011 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given
           to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by
           the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the
           suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

12:023:012 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
           Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which
           Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD,
           did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and
           cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.

12:023:013 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on
           the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the
           king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of
           the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the
           Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of
           Ammon, did the king defile.

12:023:014 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves,
           and filled their places with the bones of men.

12:023:015 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place
           which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had
           made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and
           burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and
           burned the grove.

12:023:016 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that
           were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of
           the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted
           it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God
           proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.

12:023:017 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of
           the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God,
           which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou
           hast done against the altar of Bethel.

12:023:018 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they
           let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came
           out of Samaria.

12:023:019 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the
           cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to
           provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them
           according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.

12:023:020 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there
           upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and
           returned to Jerusalem.

12:023:021 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the
           passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book
           of this covenant.

12:023:022 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of
           the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the
           kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;

12:023:023 But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this
           passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.

12:023:024 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards,
           and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that
           were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah
           put away, that he might perform the words of the law which
           were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the
           house of the LORD.

12:023:025 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to
           the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with
           all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither
           after him arose there any like him.

12:023:026 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his
           great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah,
           because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him
           withal.

12:023:027 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight,
           as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city
           Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said,
           My name shall be there.

12:023:028 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are
           they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
           Judah?

12:023:029 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the
           king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went
           against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

12:023:030 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,
           and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own
           sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of
           Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's
           stead.

12:023:031 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
           reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his
           mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

12:023:032 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his fathers had done.

12:023:033 And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of
           Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land
           to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of
           gold.

12:023:034 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the
           room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim,
           and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.

12:023:035 And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he
           taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment
           of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people
           of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give
           it unto Pharaohnechoh.

12:023:036 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
           reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his
           mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

12:023:037 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his fathers had done.

12:024:001 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and
           Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and
           rebelled against him.

12:024:002 And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands
           of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the
           children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it,
           according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his
           servants the prophets.

12:024:003 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to
           remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh,
           according to all that he did;

12:024:004 And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled
           Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not
           pardon.

12:024:005 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,
           are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
           kings of Judah?

12:024:006 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
           reigned in his stead.

12:024:007 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:
           for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto
           the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.

12:024:008 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and
           he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name
           was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

12:024:009 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his father had done.

12:024:010 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
           came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.

12:024:011 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and
           his servants did besiege it.

12:024:012 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of
           Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his
           princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in
           the eighth year of his reign.

12:024:013 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of
           the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in
           pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel
           had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.

12:024:014 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and
           all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and
           all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest
           sort of the people of the land.

12:024:015 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's
           mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty
           of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to
           Babylon.

12:024:016 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen
           and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war,
           even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.

12:024:017 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother
           king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.

12:024:018 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,
           and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
           name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

12:024:019 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

12:024:020 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
           and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that
           Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

12:025:001 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the
           tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
           Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host,
           against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built
           forts against it round about.

12:025:002 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
           Zedekiah.

12:025:003 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed
           in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the
           land.

12:025:004 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by
           night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by
           the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city
           round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.

12:025:005 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and
           overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were
           scattered from him.

12:025:006 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of
           Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.

12:025:007 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put
           out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass,
           and carried him to Babylon.

12:025:008 And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which
           is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
           came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king
           of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:

12:025:009 And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and
           all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt
           he with fire.

12:025:010 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain
           of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.

12:025:011 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
           fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the
           remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the
           guard carry away.

12:025:012 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of
           the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.

12:025:013 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,
           and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the
           LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass
           of them to Babylon.

12:025:014 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
           spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they
           ministered, took they away.

12:025:015 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of
           gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the
           guard took away.

12:025:016 The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made
           for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was
           without weight.

12:025:017 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the
           chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter
           three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the
           chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had
           the second pillar with wreathen work.

12:025:018 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
           and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the
           door:

12:025:019 And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the
           men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's
           presence, which were found in the city, and the principal
           scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and
           threescore men of the people of the land that were found in
           the city:

12:025:020 And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought
           them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:

12:025:021 And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in
           the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their
           land.

12:025:022 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
           Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he
           made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.

12:025:023 And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,
           heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor,
           there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
           Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son
           of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a
           Maachathite, they and their men.

12:025:024 And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto
           them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in
           the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well
           with you.

12:025:025 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
           of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came,
           and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and
           the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.

12:025:026 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of
           the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of
           the Chaldees.

12:025:027 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
           captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
           on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach
           king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up
           the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;

12:025:028 And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the
           throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;

12:025:029 And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread
           continually before him all the days of his life.

12:025:030 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the
           king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

13:002:035 And Sheshan gave his daughter to Jarha his servant to wife;
           and she bare him Attai.

13:002:036 And Attai begat Nathan, and Nathan begat Zabad,

           Mareshah the father of Hebron.

13:002:050 These were the sons of Caleb the son of Hur, the firstborn of
           Ephratah; Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim.

13:002:051 Salma the father of Bethlehem, Hareph the father of Bethgader.

13:002:052 And Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim had sons; Haroeh, and
           half of the Manahethites.

13:002:053 And the families of Kirjathjearim; the Ithrites, and the
           Puhites, and the Shumathites, and the Mishraites; of them came
           the Zareathites, and the Eshtaulites,

13:002:054 The sons of Salma; Bethlehem, and the Netophathites, Ataroth,
           the house of Joab, and half of the Manahethites, the Zorites.

13:002:055 And the families of the scribes which dwelt at Jabez; the
           Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites. These are the
           Kenites that came of Hemath, the father of the house of
           Rechab.

13:003:001 Now these were the sons of David, which were born unto him in

           These are the sons of Hur, the firstborn of Ephratah, the

13:004:008 And Coz begat Anub, and Zobebah, and the families of Aharhel

13:004:009 And Jabez was more honourable than his brethren: and his
           mother called his name Jabez, saying, Because I bare him with
           sorrow.

13:004:010 And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou
           wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine
           hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from
           evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that
           which he requested.

13:004:011 And Chelub the brother of Shuah begat Mehir, which was the

13:004:014 And Meonothai begat Ophrah: and Seraiah begat Joab, the father
           of the valley of Charashim; for they were craftsmen.

13:004:015 And the sons of Caleb the son of Jephunneh; Iru, Elah, and

           Ashbea,

13:004:022 And Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who
           had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubilehem. And these are
           ancient things.

13:004:023 These were the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and
           hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work.

13:004:024 The sons of Simeon were, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and

13:004:026 And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son,
           Shimei his son.

13:004:027 And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters: but his
           brethren had not many children, neither did all their family
           multiply, like to the children of Judah.

13:004:028 And they dwelt at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual,

13:004:029 And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,

13:004:030 And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag,

13:004:031 And at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and at Bethbirei, and at
           Shaaraim. These were their cities unto the reign of David.

13:004:032 And their villages were, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen,
           and Ashan, five cities:

13:004:033 And all their villages that were round about the same cities,
           unto Baal. These were their habitations, and their genealogy.

13:004:034 And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah, the son of Amaziah,

13:004:035 And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah,
           the son of Asiel,

13:004:036 And Elioenai, and Jaakobah, and Jeshohaiah, and Asaiah, and
           Adiel, and Jesimiel, and Benaiah,

13:004:037 And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of
           Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;

13:004:038 These mentioned by their names were princes in their families:
           and the house of their fathers increased greatly.

13:004:039 And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east
           side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

13:004:040 And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide,
           and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of
           old.

13:004:041 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of
           Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were
           found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and
           dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for
           their flocks.

13:004:042 And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred
           men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah,
           and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.

13:004:043 And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped,
           and dwelt there unto this day.

13:005:001 Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was
           the firstborn; but forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed,
           his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of
           Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the
           birthright.

13:005:002 For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the
           chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)

13:005:003 The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were,
           Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

13:005:004 The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his
           son,

13:005:005 Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,

13:005:006 Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried
           away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.

13:005:007 And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of
           their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and
           Zechariah,

13:005:008 And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,
           who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:

13:005:009 And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the
           wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were
           multiplied in the land of Gilead.

13:005:010 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who
           fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout
           all the east land of Gilead.

13:005:011 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land
           of Bashan unto Salcah:

13:005:012 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat
           in Bashan.

13:005:013 And their brethren of the house of their fathers were,
           Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and
           Zia, and Heber, seven.

13:005:014 These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of
           Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of
           Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;

13:005:015 Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of
           their fathers.

13:005:016 And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in
           all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.

13:005:017 All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham
           king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.

13:005:018 The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of
           Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword,
           and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty
           thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the
           war.

13:005:019 And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish,
           and Nodab.

13:005:020 And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were
           delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for
           they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them;
           because they put their trust in him.

13:005:021 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty
           thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of
           asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.

13:005:022 For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God.
           And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

13:005:023 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the
           land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir,
           and unto mount Hermon.

13:005:024 And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even
           Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and
           Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and
           heads of the house of their fathers.

13:005:025 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and
           went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom
           God destroyed before them.

13:005:026 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of
           Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria,
           and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the
           Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto
           Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this
           day.

13:006:001 The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

13:006:002 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.

13:006:003 And the children of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam. The
           sons also of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

13:006:004 Eleazar begat Phinehas, Phinehas begat Abishua,

13:006:005 And Abishua begat Bukki, and Bukki begat Uzzi,

           priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in
           Jerusalem:)

13:006:011 And Azariah begat Amariah, and Amariah begat Ahitub,

13:006:012 And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Shallum,

13:006:013 And Shallum begat Hilkiah, and Hilkiah begat Azariah,

13:006:014 And Azariah begat Seraiah, and Seraiah begat Jehozadak,

13:006:015 And Jehozadak went into captivity, when the LORD carried away
           Judah and Jerusalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar.

13:006:016 The sons of Levi; Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.

13:006:017 And these be the names of the sons of Gershom; Libni, and
           Shimei.

13:006:018 And the sons of Kohath were, Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and
           Uzziel.

13:006:019 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. And these are the

13:006:031 And these are they whom David set over the service of song in
           the house of the LORD, after that the ark had rest.

13:006:032 And they ministered before the dwelling place of the
           tabernacle of the congregation with singing, until Solomon had
           built the house of the LORD in Jerusalem: and then they waited
           on their office according to their order.

13:006:049 But Aaron and his sons offered upon the altar of the burnt

           all the work of the place most holy, and to make an atonement

13:007:003 And the sons of Uzzi; Izrahiah: and the sons of Izrahiah;

           fathers, were bands of soldiers for war, six and thirty
           thousand men: for they had many wives and sons.

13:007:005 And their brethren among all the families of Issachar were

           concubine the Aramitess bare Machir the father of Gilead:

13:007:015 And Machir took to wife the sister of Huppim and Shuppim,
           whose sister's name was Maachah;) and the name of the second
           was Zelophehad: and Zelophehad had daughters.

13:007:016 And Maachah the wife of Machir bare a son, and she called his
           name Peresh; and the name of his brother was Sheresh; and his
           sons were Ulam and Rakem.

           whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because
           they came down to take away their cattle.

13:007:022 And Ephraim their father mourned many days, and his brethren
           came to comfort him.

13:007:023 And when he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bare a
           son, and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with
           his house.

13:007:024 (And his daughter was Sherah, who built Bethhoron the nether,
           and the upper, and Uzzensherah.)

13:007:040 All these were the children of Asher, heads of their father's
           house, choice and mighty men of valour, chief of the princes.
           And the number throughout the genealogy of them that were apt
           to the war and to battle was twenty and six thousand men.

13:008:001 Now Benjamin begat Bela his firstborn, Ashbel the second, and
           Aharah the third,

13:008:002 Nohah the fourth, and Rapha the fifth.

13:008:029 And at Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon; whose wife's name

           are of the sons of Benjamin.

13:009:001 So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they
           were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who
           were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.

13:009:002 Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in
           their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and
           the Nethinims.

13:009:003 And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the

           of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of
           the house of God;

13:009:012 And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of
           Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah,
           the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of
           Immer;

13:009:013 And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a
           thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for
           the work of the service of the house of God.

13:009:014 And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of
           Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;

13:009:015 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of
           Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;

13:009:016 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of
           Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah,
           that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.

13:009:017 And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and
           Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;

13:009:018 Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were
           porters in the companies of the children of Levi.

13:009:019 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of
           Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the
           Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the
           gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the
           host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.

13:009:020 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in
           time past, and the LORD was with him.

13:009:021 And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of
           the tabernacle of the congregation.

13:009:022 All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were
           two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy
           in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain
           in their set office.

13:009:023 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of
           the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by
           wards.

13:009:024 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west,
           north, and south.

13:009:025 And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come
           after seven days from time to time with them.

13:009:026 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set
           office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house
           of God.

13:009:027 And they lodged round about the house of God, because the
           charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning
           pertained to them.

13:009:028 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels,
           that they should bring them in and out by tale.

13:009:029 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and
           all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and
           the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

13:009:030 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the
           spices.

13:009:031 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of
           Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that
           were made in the pans.

13:009:032 And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites,
           were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.

13:009:033 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the
           Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they
           were employed in that work day and night.

13:009:034 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their
           generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.

13:009:035 And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's
           name was Maachah:

13:009:036 And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and
           Ner, and Nadab.

13:009:037 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.

13:009:038 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their
           brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.

13:009:039 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat
           Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

13:009:040 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat
           Micah.

13:009:041 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea,
           and Ahaz.

13:009:042 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth,
           and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;

13:009:043 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son,
           Azel his son.

13:009:044 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam,
           Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan:
           these were the sons of Azel.

13:010:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of
           Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
           in mount Gilboa.

13:010:002 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his
           sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
           Malchishua, the sons of Saul.

13:010:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
           him, and he was wounded of the archers.

13:010:004 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
           me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse
           me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So
           Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

13:010:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
           likewise on the sword, and died.

13:010:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died
           together.

13:010:007 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw
           that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then
           they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came
           and dwelt in them.

13:010:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
           to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen
           in mount Gilboa.

13:010:009 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his
           armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about,
           to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

13:010:010 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and
           fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

13:010:011 And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had
           done to Saul,

13:010:012 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of
           Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh,
           and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted
           seven days.

13:010:013 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against
           the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept
           not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar
           spirit, to enquire of it;

13:010:014 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and
           turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

13:011:001 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron,
           saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

13:011:002 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast
           he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy
           God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou
           shalt be ruler over my people Israel.

13:011:003 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron;
           and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD;
           and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the
           word of the LORD by Samuel.

13:011:004 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus;
           where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.

13:011:005 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not
           come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which
           is the city of David.

13:011:006 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be
           chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up,
           and was chief.

13:011:007 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the
           city of David.

13:011:008 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round
           about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

13:011:009 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was
           with him.

13:011:010 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who
           strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all
           Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD
           concerning Israel.

13:011:011 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;
           Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted
           up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.

13:011:012 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who
           was one of the three mighties.

13:011:013 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were
           gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full
           of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

13:011:014 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and
           delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved
           them by a great deliverance.

13:011:015 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to
           David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the
           Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

13:011:016 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison
           was then at Bethlehem.

13:011:017 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
           the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!

13:011:018 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and
           drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate,
           and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not
           drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.

13:011:019 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing:
           shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives
           in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought
           it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these
           three mightiest.

13:011:020 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three:
           for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them,
           and had a name among the three.

13:011:021 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was
           their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.

13:011:022 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of
           Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of
           Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy
           day.

13:011:023 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits
           high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's
           beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the
           spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own
           spear.

13:011:024 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
           among the three mighties.

13:011:025 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not
           to the first three: and David set him over his guard.

13:011:026 Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of
           Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

13:011:027 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

13:011:028 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,

13:011:029 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

13:011:030 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the
           Netophathite,

13:011:031 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the
           children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

13:011:032 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

13:011:033 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

13:011:034 The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the
           Hararite,

13:011:035 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,

13:011:036 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

13:011:037 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,

13:011:038 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,

13:011:039 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of
           Joab the son of Zeruiah,

13:011:040 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

13:011:041 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

13:011:042 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the
           Reubenites, and thirty with him,

13:011:043 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,

13:011:044 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan
           the Aroerite,

13:011:045 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,

13:011:046 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of
           Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

13:011:047 Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.

13:012:001 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet
           kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they
           were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.

13:012:002 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand
           and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a
           bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.

13:012:003 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
           Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and
           Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.

13:012:004 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and
           over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and
           Josabad the Gederathite,

13:012:005 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and
           Shephatiah the Haruphite,

13:012:006 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam,
           the Korhites,

13:012:007 And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

13:012:008 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into
           the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit
           for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose
           faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the
           roes upon the mountains;

13:012:009 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

13:012:010 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

13:012:011 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

13:012:012 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

13:012:013 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.

13:012:014 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of
           the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a
           thousand.

13:012:015 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when
           it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all
           them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the
           west.

13:012:016 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the
           hold unto David.

13:012:017 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto
           them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart
           shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine
           enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of
           our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.

13:012:018 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the
           captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side,
           thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to
           thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received
           them, and made them captains of the band.

13:012:019 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with
           the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them
           not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him
           away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy
           of our heads.

13:012:020 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah,
           and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu,
           and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.

13:012:021 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they
           were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.

13:012:022 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,
           until it was a great host, like the host of God.

13:012:023 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed
           to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom
           of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.

13:012:024 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six
           thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.

13:012:025 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,
           seven thousand and one hundred.

13:012:026 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.

13:012:027 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him
           were three thousand and seven hundred;

13:012:028 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's
           house twenty and two captains.

13:012:029 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
           thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the
           ward of the house of Saul.

13:012:030 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight
           hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of
           their fathers.

13:012:031 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which
           were expressed by name, to come and make David king.

13:012:032 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had
           understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do;
           the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren
           were at their commandment.

13:012:033 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with
           all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank:
           they were not of double heart.

13:012:034 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield
           and spear thirty and seven thousand.

13:012:035 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and
           six hundred.

13:012:036 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war,
           forty thousand.

13:012:037 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the
           Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of
           instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty
           thousand.

13:012:038 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a
           perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel:
           and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make
           David king.

13:012:039 And there they were with David three days, eating and
           drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.

13:012:040 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and
           Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels,
           and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and
           bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep
           abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

13:013:001 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and
           hundreds, and with every leader.

13:013:002 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem
           good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send
           abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the
           land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites
           which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather
           themselves unto us:

13:013:003 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we
           enquired not at it in the days of Saul.

13:013:004 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the
           thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

13:013:005 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt
           even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from
           Kirjathjearim.

13:013:006 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to
           Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the
           ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims,
           whose name is called on it.

13:013:007 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house
           of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

13:013:008 And David and all Israel played before God with all their
           might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries,
           and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

13:013:009 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
           forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

13:013:010 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he
           smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he
           died before God.

13:013:011 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
           upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this
           day.

13:013:012 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I
           bring the ark of God home to me?

13:013:013 So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of
           David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the
           Gittite.

13:013:014 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his
           house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of
           Obededom, and all that he had.

13:014:001 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of
           cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.

13:014:002 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over
           Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his
           people Israel.

13:014:003 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more
           sons and daughters.

13:014:004 Now these are the names of his children which he had in
           Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

13:014:005 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

13:014:006 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

13:014:007 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

13:014:008 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king
           over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David.
           And David heard of it, and went out against them.

13:014:009 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley
           of Rephaim.

13:014:010 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
           Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And
           the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into
           thine hand.

13:014:011 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there.
           Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine
           hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called
           the name of that place Baalperazim.

13:014:012 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a
           commandment, and they were burned with fire.

13:014:013 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
           valley.

13:014:014 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him,
           Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them
           over against the mulberry trees.

13:014:015 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the
           tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to
           battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of
           the Philistines.

13:014:016 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
           host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

13:014:017 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD
           brought the fear of him upon all nations.

13:015:001 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a
           place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

13:015:002 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
           Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of
           God, and to minister unto him for ever.

13:015:003 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring
           up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared
           for it.

13:015:004 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

13:015:005 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an
           hundred and twenty:

13:015:006 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two
           hundred and twenty:

13:015:007 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an
           hundred and thirty:

13:015:008 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren
           two hundred:

13:015:009 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren
           fourscore:

13:015:010 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren
           an hundred and twelve.

13:015:011 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for
           the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel,
           and Amminadab,

13:015:012 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the
           Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that
           ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the
           place that I have prepared for it.

13:015:013 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made
           a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due
           order.

13:015:014 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring
           up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

13:015:015 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
           shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded
           according to the word of the LORD.

13:015:016 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
           brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick,
           psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the
           voice with joy.

13:015:017 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his
           brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of
           Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

13:015:018 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah,
           Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni,
           Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
           Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

13:015:019 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to
           sound with cymbals of brass;

13:015:020 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and
           Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on
           Alamoth;

13:015:021 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and
           Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.

13:015:022 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he
           instructed about the song, because he was skilful.

13:015:023 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

13:015:024 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
           Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow
           with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and
           Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

13:015:025 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over
           thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.

13:015:026 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the
           ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven
           bullocks and seven rams.

13:015:027 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
           Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the
           master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him
           an ephod of linen.

13:015:028 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with
           trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and
           harps.

13:015:029 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul
           looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing:
           and she despised him in her heart.

13:016:001 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the
           tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt
           sacrifices and peace offerings before God.

13:016:002 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
           and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of
           the LORD.

13:016:003 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to
           every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a
           flagon of wine.

13:016:004 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the
           ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the
           LORD God of Israel:

13:016:005 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and
           Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and
           Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with
           harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;

13:016:006 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets
           continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

13:016:007 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the
           LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

13:016:008 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his
           deeds among the people.

13:016:009 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his
           wondrous works.

13:016:010 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
           seek the LORD.

13:016:011 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

13:016:012 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,
           and the judgments of his mouth;

13:016:013 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his
           chosen ones.

13:016:014 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

13:016:015 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he
           commanded to a thousand generations;

13:016:016 Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his
           oath unto Isaac;

13:016:017 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel
           for an everlasting covenant,

13:016:018 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
           your inheritance;

13:016:019 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

13:016:020 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom
           to another people;

13:016:021 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
           for their sakes,

13:016:022 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

13:016:023 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day
           his salvation.

13:016:024 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works
           among all nations.

13:016:025 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is
           to be feared above all gods.

13:016:026 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made
           the heavens.

13:016:027 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness
           are in his place.

13:016:028 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
           LORD glory and strength.

13:016:029 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
           offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty
           of holiness.

13:016:030 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be
           stable, that it be not moved.

13:016:031 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let
           men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.

13:016:032 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
           rejoice, and all that is therein.

13:016:033 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of
           the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.

13:016:034 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

13:016:035 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
           together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give
           thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.

13:016:036 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all
           the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

13:016:037 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark
           continually, as every day's work required:

13:016:038 And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight;
           Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:

13:016:039 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the
           tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,

13:016:040 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the
           burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do
           according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which
           he commanded Israel;

13:016:041 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were
           chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the
           LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever;

13:016:042 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for
           those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments
           of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.

13:016:043 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David
           returned to bless his house.

13:017:001 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David
           said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars,
           but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under
           curtains.

13:017:002 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart;
           for God is with thee.

13:017:003 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came
           to Nathan, saying,

13:017:004 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt
           not build me an house to dwell in:

13:017:005 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought
           up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and
           from one tabernacle to another.

13:017:006 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to
           any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my
           people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?

13:017:007 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
           saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even
           from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my
           people Israel:

13:017:008 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and
           have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made
           thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the
           earth.

13:017:009 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will
           plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be
           moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste
           them any more, as at the beginning,

13:017:010 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
           people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.
           Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an
           house.

13:017:011 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou
           must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed
           after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish
           his kingdom.

13:017:012 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for
           ever.

13:017:013 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not
           take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was
           before thee:

13:017:014 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for
           ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.

13:017:015 According to all these words, and according to all this
           vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

13:017:016 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who
           am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast
           brought me hitherto?

13:017:017 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou
           hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to
           come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of
           high degree, O LORD God.

13:017:018 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy
           servant? for thou knowest thy servant.

13:017:019 O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own
           heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all
           these great things.

13:017:020 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God
           beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our
           ears.

13:017:021 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel,
           whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a
           name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations
           from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?

13:017:022 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for
           ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.

13:017:023 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken
           concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established
           for ever, and do as thou hast said.

13:017:024 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for
           ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a
           God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be
           established before thee.

13:017:025 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
           him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to
           pray before thee.

13:017:026 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness
           unto thy servant:

13:017:027 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy
           servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou
           blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.

13:018:001 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the
           Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out
           of the hand of the Philistines.

13:018:002 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants,
           and brought gifts.

13:018:003 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he
           went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

13:018:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven
           thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also
           houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an
           hundred chariots.

13:018:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king
           of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand
           men.

13:018:006 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians
           became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD
           preserved David whithersoever he went.

13:018:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
           of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

13:018:008 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,
           brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the
           brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

13:018:009 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all
           the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

13:018:010 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his
           welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought
           against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war
           with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and
           silver and brass.

13:018:011 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver
           and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from
           Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from
           the Philistines, and from Amalek.

13:018:012 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in
           the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

13:018:013 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
           David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever
           he went.

13:018:014 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
           justice among all his people.

13:018:015 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
           the son of Ahilud, recorder.

13:018:016 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of
           Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

13:018:017 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and
           the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the
           king.

13:019:001 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the
           children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

13:019:002 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
           Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David
           sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the
           servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon
           to Hanun, to comfort him.

13:019:003 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun,
           Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath
           sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee
           for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?

13:019:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and
           cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks,
           and sent them away.

13:019:005 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were
           served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly
           ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards
           be grown, and then return.

13:019:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made
           themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon
           sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and
           horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out
           of Zobah.

13:019:007 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king
           of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba.
           And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from
           their cities, and came to battle.

13:019:008 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
           the mighty men.

13:019:009 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
           array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were
           come were by themselves in the field.

13:019:010 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before
           and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put
           them in array against the Syrians.

13:019:011 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of
           Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against
           the children of Ammon.

13:019:012 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
           shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
           thee, then I will help thee.

13:019:013 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
           our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do
           that which is good in his sight.

13:019:014 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
           Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.

13:019:015 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
           they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered
           into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

13:019:016 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse
           before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the
           Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain
           of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

13:019:017 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed
           over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array
           against them. So when David had put the battle in array
           against the Syrians, they fought with him.

13:019:018 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the
           Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty
           thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

13:019:019 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to
           the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and
           became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the
           children of Ammon any more.

13:020:001 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the
           time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of
           the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and
           came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And
           Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.

13:020:002 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and
           found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious
           stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought
           also exceeding much spoil out of the city.

13:020:003 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them
           with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so
           dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And
           David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

13:020:004 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer
           with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite
           slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they
           were subdued.

13:020:005 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the
           son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
           whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.

13:020:006 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great
           stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on
           each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the
           giant.

13:020:007 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's
           brother slew him.

13:020:008 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the
           hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

13:021:001 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to
           number Israel.

13:021:002 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
           number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number
           of them to me, that I may know it.

13:021:003 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times
           so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not
           all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this
           thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?

13:021:004 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore
           Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to
           Jerusalem.

13:021:005 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.
           And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred
           thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred
           threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.

13:021:006 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the
           king's word was abominable to Joab.

13:021:007 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
           Israel.

13:021:008 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have
           done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity
           of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

13:021:009 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,

13:021:010 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee
           three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto
           thee.

13:021:011 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
           Choose thee

13:021:012 Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed
           before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies
           overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD,
           even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD
           destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore
           advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent
           me.

13:021:013 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall
           now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies:
           but let me not fall into the hand of man.

13:021:014 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
           Israel seventy thousand men.

13:021:015 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he
           was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the
           evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay
           now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the
           threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

13:021:016 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
           stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword
           in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the
           elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon
           their faces.

13:021:017 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people
           to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil
           indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine
           hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's
           house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.

13:021:018 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that
           David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the
           threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

13:021:019 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
           name of the LORD.

13:021:020 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons
           with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

13:021:021 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and
           went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David
           with his face to the ground.

13:021:022 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this
           threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the
           LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the
           plague may be stayed from the people.

13:021:023 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord
           the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee
           the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing
           instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I
           give it all.

13:021:024 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it
           for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine
           for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.

13:021:025 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of
           gold by weight.

13:021:026 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
           burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD;
           and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of
           burnt offering.

13:021:027 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword
           again into the sheath thereof.

13:021:028 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in
           the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed
           there.

13:021:029 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the
           wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that
           season in the high place at Gibeon.

13:021:030 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
           afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

13:022:001 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this
           is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

13:022:002 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were
           in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones
           to build the house of God.

13:022:003 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the
           doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in
           abundance without weight;

13:022:004 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of
           Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

13:022:005 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the
           house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding
           magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I
           will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared
           abundantly before his death.

13:022:006 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build
           an house for the LORD God of Israel.

13:022:007 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my
           mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:

13:022:008 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed
           blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not
           build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood
           upon the earth in my sight.

13:022:009 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of
           rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round
           about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace
           and quietness unto Israel in his days.

13:022:010 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son,
           and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of
           his kingdom over Israel for ever.

13:022:011 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and
           build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.

13:022:012 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give
           thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law
           of the LORD thy God.

13:022:013 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
           statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with
           concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not,
           nor be dismayed.

13:022:014 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of
           the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand
           thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without
           weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I
           prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.

13:022:015 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
           workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for
           every manner of work.

13:022:016 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is
           no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with
           thee.

13:022:017 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
           his son, saying,

13:022:018 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you
           rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the
           land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD,
           and before his people.

13:022:019 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;
           arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God,
           to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy
           vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name
           of the LORD.

13:023:001 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his
           son king over Israel.

13:023:002 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the
           priests and the Levites.

13:023:003 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
           upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was
           thirty and eight thousand.

13:023:004 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the
           work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers
           and judges:

13:023:005 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised
           the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to
           praise therewith.

13:023:006 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,
           namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

13:023:007 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.

13:023:008 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and
           Joel, three.

13:023:009 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
           These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.

13:023:010 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and
           Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

13:023:011 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and
           Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one
           reckoning, according to their father's house.

13:023:012 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

13:023:013 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,
           that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons
           for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto
           him, and to bless in his name for ever.

13:023:014 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of
           the tribe of Levi.

13:023:015 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.

13:023:016 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

13:023:017 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer
           had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

13:023:018 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

13:023:019 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
           Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

13:023:020 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.

13:023:021 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;
           Eleazar, and Kish.

13:023:022 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their
           brethren the sons of Kish took them.

13:023:023 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

13:023:024 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;
           even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number
           of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of
           the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and
           upward.

13:023:025 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto
           his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:

13:023:026 And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the
           tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.

13:023:027 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from
           twenty years old and above:

13:023:028 Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the
           service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the
           chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the
           work of the service of the house of God;

13:023:029 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat
           offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is
           baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all
           manner of measure and size;

13:023:030 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and
           likewise at even:

13:023:031 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the
           sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number,
           according to the order commanded unto them, continually before
           the LORD:

13:023:032 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge
           of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the
           house of the LORD.

13:024:001 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of
           Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

13:024:002 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no
           children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's
           office.

13:024:003 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,
           and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their
           offices in their service.

13:024:004 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar
           than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among
           the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house
           of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar
           according to the house of their fathers.

13:024:005 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
           governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God,
           were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

13:024:006 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the
           Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and
           Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and
           before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites:
           one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken
           for Ithamar.

           Gamul,

13:024:018 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to
           Maaziah.

13:024:019 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into
           the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron
           their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.

13:024:020 And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of
           Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

13:024:021 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was
           Isshiah.

13:024:025 The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;
           Zechariah.

13:024:026 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah;
           Beno.

13:024:027 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur,
           and Ibri.

13:024:028 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

13:024:029 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.

13:024:030 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These
           were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.

13:024:031 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons
           of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and
           Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and
           Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger
           brethren.

13:025:001 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the
           service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun,
           who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with
           cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their
           service was:

13:025:002 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and
           Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which
           prophesied according to the order of the king.

13:025:003 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and
           Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of
           their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give
           thanks and to praise the LORD.

           and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and
           Mahazioth:

13:025:005 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words
           of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen
           sons and three daughters.

13:025:006 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the
           house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for
           the service of the house of God, according to the king's order
           to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

13:025:007 So the number of them, with their brethren that were
           instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were
           cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

13:025:008 And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as
           the great, the teacher as the scholar.

13:025:009 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second
           to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:

13:026:001 Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was
           Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

13:026:002 And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn,
           Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

13:026:003 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.

13:026:004 Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn,
           Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth,
           and Nethaneel the fifth.

13:026:005 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth:
           for God blessed him.

13:026:006 Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled
           throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men
           of valour.

13:026:007 The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad,
           whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

13:026:008 All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and
           their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were
           threescore and two of Obededom.

13:026:009 And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.

13:026:010 Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the
           chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father
           made him the chief;)

13:026:011 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth:
           all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

13:026:012 Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the
           chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in
           the house of the LORD.

13:026:013 And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according
           to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

13:026:014 And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his
           son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out
           northward.

13:026:015 To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.

13:026:016 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the
           gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward
           against ward.

13:026:017 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward
           four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two.

13:026:018 At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

13:026:019 These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore,
           and among the sons of Merari.

13:026:020 And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house
           of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.

13:026:021 As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite
           Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were
           Jehieli.

13:026:022 The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were
           over the treasures of the house of the LORD.

13:026:023 Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the
           Uzzielites:

13:026:024 And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of
           the treasures.

13:026:025 And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah
           his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith
           his son.

13:026:026 Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures
           of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief
           fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the
           captains of the host, had dedicated.

13:026:027 Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain
           the house of the LORD.

13:026:028 And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and
           Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had
           dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under
           the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.

13:026:029 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward
           business over Israel, for officers and judges.

13:026:030 And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of
           valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them
           of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of
           the LORD, and in the service of the king.

13:026:031 Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the
           Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In
           the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for,
           and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer
           of Gilead.

13:026:032 And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven
           hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the
           Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for
           every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.

13:027:001 Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the
           chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and
           their officers that served the king in any matter of the
           courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout
           all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and
           four thousand.

13:027:002 Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the
           son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four
           thousand.

13:027:003 Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of
           the host for the first month.

13:027:004 And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite,
           and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course

           the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were
           twenty and four thousand.

13:027:006 This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and
           above the thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son.

13:027:007 The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother
           of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course
           were twenty and four thousand.

13:027:008 The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the
           Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

13:027:009 The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of
           Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four
           thousand.

13:027:010 The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the
           Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were
           twenty and four thousand.

13:027:011 The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the
           Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and
           four thousand.

13:027:012 The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the
           Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty
           and four thousand.

13:027:013 The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the
           Netophathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty
           and four thousand.

13:027:014 The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the
           Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course
           were twenty and four thousand.

13:027:015 The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the
           Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and
           four thousand.

13:027:016 Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the
           Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites,
           Shephatiah the son of Maachah:

13:027:017 Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites,
           Zadok:

13:027:018 Of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of David: of Issachar,

           the son of Azriel:

13:027:020 Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the
           half tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:

13:027:021 Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of
           Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:

13:027:022 Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of
           the tribes of Israel.

13:027:023 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old
           and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel
           like to the stars of the heavens.

13:027:024 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,
           because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was
           the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.

13:027:025 And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel:
           and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in
           the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of
           Uzziah:

13:027:026 And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of
           the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

13:027:027 And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the
           increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the
           Shiphmite:

13:027:028 And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in
           the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the
           cellars of oil was Joash:

13:027:029 And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the
           Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was
           Shaphat the son of Adlai:

13:027:030 Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the
           asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:

13:027:031 And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the
           rulers of the substance which was king David's.

13:027:032 Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and
           a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's
           sons:

13:027:033 And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the
           Archite was the king's companion:

13:027:034 And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and
           Abiathar: and the general of the king's army was Joab.

13:028:001 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of
           the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered
           to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands,
           and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the
           substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with
           the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the
           valiant men, unto Jerusalem.

13:028:002 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me,
           my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to
           build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for
           the building:

13:028:003 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my
           name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed
           blood.

13:028:004 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house
           of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath
           chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the
           house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked
           me to make me king over all Israel:

13:028:005 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he
           hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the
           kingdom of the LORD over Israel.

13:028:006 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house
           and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will
           be his father.

13:028:007 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be
           constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this
           day.

13:028:008 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of
           the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for
           all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess
           this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your
           children after you for ever.

13:028:009 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and
           serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for
           the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the
           imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be
           found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
           for ever.

13:028:010 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house
           for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

13:028:011 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch,
           and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and
           of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours
           thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,

13:028:012 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the
           courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round
           about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the
           treasuries of the dedicated things:

13:028:013 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for
           all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for
           all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.

13:028:014 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all
           instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all
           instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every
           kind of service:

13:028:015 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their
           lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the
           lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight,
           both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof,
           according to the use of every candlestick.

13:028:016 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for
           every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:

13:028:017 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the
           cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for
           every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of
           silver:

13:028:018 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold
           for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread
           out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the
           LORD.

13:028:019 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing
           by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.

13:028:020 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
           courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD
           God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee,
           nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for
           the service of the house of the LORD.

13:028:021 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even
           they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of
           God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of
           workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of
           service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at
           thy commandment.

13:029:001 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
           Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and
           tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man,
           but for the LORD God.

13:029:002 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God
           the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for
           things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron
           for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones,
           and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers
           colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones
           in abundance.

13:029:003 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my
           God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which
           I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I
           have prepared for the holy house.

13:029:004 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
           seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls
           of the houses withal:

13:029:005 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of
           silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of
           artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service
           this day unto the LORD?

13:029:006 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of
           Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the
           rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,

13:029:007 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five
           thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten
           thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and
           one hundred thousand talents of iron.

13:029:008 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
           treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the
           Gershonite.

13:029:009 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
           because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD:
           and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

13:029:010 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
           and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our
           father, for ever and ever.

13:029:011 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
           and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the
           heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O
           LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.

13:029:012 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over
           all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand
           it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.

13:029:013 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
           name.

13:029:014 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
           offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of
           thee, and of thine own have we given thee.

13:029:015 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all
           our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there
           is none abiding.

13:029:016 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
           thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is
           all thine own.

13:029:017 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
           pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine
           heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have
           I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer
           willingly unto thee.

13:029:018 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
           this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart
           of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:

13:029:019 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy
           commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all
           these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have
           made provision.

13:029:020 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD
           your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of
           their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the
           LORD, and the king.

13:029:021 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered
           burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day,
           even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand
           lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance
           for all Israel:

13:029:022 And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great
           gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the
           second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief
           governor, and Zadok to be priest.

13:029:023 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of
           David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

13:029:024 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
           likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the
           king.

13:029:025 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
           Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not
           been on any king before him in Israel.

13:029:026 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

13:029:027 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years;
           seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
           reigned he in Jerusalem.

13:029:028 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and
           honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

13:029:029 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they
           are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of
           Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

13:029:030 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over
           him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the
           countries.

Book 14        2 Chronicles

14:001:001 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
           and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him
           exceedingly.

14:001:002 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of
           thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every
           governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.

14:001:003 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the
           high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of
           the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD
           had made in the wilderness.

14:001:004 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to
           the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched
           a tent for it at Jerusalem.

14:001:005 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the
           son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the
           LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.

14:001:006 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the
           LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and
           offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.

14:001:007 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,
           Ask what I shall give thee.

14:001:008 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto
           David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.

14:001:009 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be
           established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the
           dust of the earth in multitude.

14:001:010 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come
           in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that
           is so great?

14:001:011 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and
           thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of
           thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast
           asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge
           my people, over whom I have made thee king:

14:001:012 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give
           thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings
           have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any
           after thee have the like.

14:001:013 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was
           at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and reigned over Israel.

14:001:014 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a
           thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
           horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the
           king at Jerusalem.

14:001:015 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
           stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are
           in the vale for abundance.

14:001:016 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
           the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

14:001:017 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot
           for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred
           and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of
           the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

14:002:001 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the
           LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

14:002:002 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
           burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and
           three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.

14:002:003 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou
           didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to
           build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.

14:002:004 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to
           dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and
           for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings
           morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
           and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an
           ordinance for ever to Israel.

14:002:005 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God
           above all gods.

14:002:006 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
           heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I
           should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before
           him?

14:002:007 Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in
           silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,
           and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men
           that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my
           father did provide.

14:002:008 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
           Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber
           in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy
           servants,

14:002:009 Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I
           am about to build shall be wonderful great.

14:002:010 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut
           timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty
           thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of
           wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

14:002:011 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent
           to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath
           made thee king over them.

14:002:012 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that
           made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise
           son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build
           an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

14:002:013 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding,
           of Huram my father's,

14:002:014 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was
           a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in
           brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue,
           and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of
           graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to
           him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord
           David thy father.

14:002:015 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the
           wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his
           servants:

14:002:016 And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt
           need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa;
           and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.

14:002:017 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land
           of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had
           numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty
           thousand and three thousand and six hundred.

14:002:018 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers
           of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the
           mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set
           the people a work.

14:003:001 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem
           in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his
           father, in the place that David had prepared in the
           threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

14:003:002 And he began to build in the second day of the second month,
           in the fourth year of his reign.

14:003:003 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for
           the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after
           the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth
           twenty cubits.

14:003:004 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length
           of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty
           cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he
           overlaid it within with pure gold.

14:003:005 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he
           overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and
           chains.

14:003:006 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
           and the gold was gold of Parvaim.

14:003:007 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the
           walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved
           cherubims on the walls.

14:003:008 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was
           according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the
           breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine
           gold, amounting to six hundred talents.

14:003:009 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he
           overlaid the upper chambers with gold.

14:003:010 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image
           work, and overlaid them with gold.

14:003:011 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one
           wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall
           of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits,
           reaching to the wing of the other cherub.

14:003:012 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to
           the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits
           also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.

14:003:013 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
           cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were
           inward.

14:003:014 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and
           fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

14:003:015 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
           cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of
           them was five cubits.

14:003:016 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the
           heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and
           put them on the chains.

14:003:017 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the
           right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of
           that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the
           left Boaz.

14:004:001 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
           thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits
           the height thereof.

14:004:002 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
           round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a
           line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

14:004:003 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
           round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about.
           Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.

14:004:004 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
           three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
           south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
           above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

14:004:005 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it
           like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies;
           and it received and held three thousand baths.

14:004:006 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and
           five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered
           for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was
           for the priests to wash in.

14:004:007 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form,
           and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five
           on the left.

14:004:008 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five
           on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an
           hundred basons of gold.

14:004:009 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great
           court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them
           with brass.

14:004:010 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
           against the south.

14:004:011 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
           Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon
           for the house of God;

14:004:012 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters
           which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths
           to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the
           top of the pillars;

14:004:013 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of
           pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the
           chapiters which were upon the pillars.

14:004:014 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;

14:004:015 One sea, and twelve oxen under it.

14:004:016 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all
           their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon
           for the house of the LORD of bright brass.

14:004:017 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
           ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.

14:004:018 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for
           the weight of the brass could not be found out.

14:004:019 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of
           God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the
           shewbread was set;

14:004:020 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should
           burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;

14:004:021 And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of
           gold, and that perfect gold;

14:004:022 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the
           censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner
           doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the
           house of the temple, were of gold.

14:005:001 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD
           was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David
           his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and
           all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house
           of God.

14:005:002 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
           of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
           Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of
           the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.

14:005:003 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the
           king in the feast which was in the seventh month.

14:005:004 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the
           ark.

14:005:005 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
           congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
           tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.

14:005:006 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that
           were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and
           oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

14:005:007 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
           unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy
           place, even under the wings of the cherubims:

14:005:008 For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of
           the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
           thereof above.

14:005:009 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
           staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were
           not seen without. And there it is unto this day.

14:005:010 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses
           put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the
           children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

14:005:011 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
           holy place: (for all the priests that were present were
           sanctified, and did not then wait by course:

14:005:012 Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph,
           of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren,
           being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries
           and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them
           an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)

14:005:013 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as
           one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking
           the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the
           trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised
           the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for
           ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the
           house of the LORD;

14:005:014 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
           the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of
           God.

14:006:001 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in
           the thick darkness.

14:006:002 But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place
           for thy dwelling for ever.

14:006:003 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole
           congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel
           stood.

14:006:004 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with
           his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my
           father David, saying,

14:006:005 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land
           of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to
           build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose
           I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:

14:006:006 But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and
           have chosen David to be over my people Israel.

14:006:007 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
           for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

14:006:008 But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in
           thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in
           that it was in thine heart:

14:006:009 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son
           which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the
           house for my name.

14:006:010 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath
           spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and
           am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have
           built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

14:006:011 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
           LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.

14:006:012 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
           all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:

14:006:013 For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long,
           and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it
           in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled
           down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and
           spread forth his hands toward heaven.

14:006:014 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in
           the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and
           shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with
           all their hearts:

14:006:015 Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that
           which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and
           hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

14:006:016 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant
           David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying,
           There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the
           throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their
           way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.

14:006:017 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified,
           which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.

14:006:018 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
           heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much
           less this house which I have built!

14:006:019 Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to
           his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
           the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:

14:006:020 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,
           upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put
           thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant
           prayeth toward this place.

14:006:021 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and
           of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place:
           hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when
           thou hearest, forgive.

14:006:022 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
           him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in
           this house;

14:006:023 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
           requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own
           head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according
           to his righteousness.

14:006:024 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
           because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and
           confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee
           in this house;

14:006:025 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy
           people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou
           gavest to them and to their fathers.

14:006:026 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
           have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place,
           and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost
           afflict them;

14:006:027 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy
           servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them
           the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy
           land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an
           inheritance.

14:006:028 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if
           there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if
           their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land;
           whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:

14:006:029 Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of
           any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall
           know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth
           his hands in this house:

14:006:030 Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive,
           and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose
           heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the
           children of men:)

14:006:031 That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they
           live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

14:006:032 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people
           Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's
           sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they
           come and pray in this house;

14:006:033 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
           and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for;
           that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee,
           as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which
           I have built is called by thy name.

14:006:034 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way
           that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this
           city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built
           for thy name;

14:006:035 Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their
           supplication, and maintain their cause.

14:006:036 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth
           not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over
           before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a
           land far off or near;

14:006:037 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are
           carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of
           their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss,
           and have dealt wickedly;

14:006:038 If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their
           soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried
           them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest
           unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast
           chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:

14:006:039 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
           their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their
           cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.

14:006:040 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let
           thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this
           place.

14:006:041 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,
           and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be
           clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in
           goodness.

14:006:042 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember
           the mercies of David thy servant.

14:007:001 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came
           down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the
           sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.

14:007:002 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
           because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.

14:007:003 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came
           down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed
           themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement,
           and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good;
           for his mercy endureth for ever.

14:007:004 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
           LORD.

14:007:005 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two
           thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so
           the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

14:007:006 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
           instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had
           made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever,
           when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded
           trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.

14:007:007 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was
           before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
           offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the
           brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive
           the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.

14:007:008 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and
           all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the
           entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.

14:007:009 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they
           kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast
           seven days.

14:007:010 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he
           sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart
           for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to
           Solomon, and to Israel his people.

14:007:011 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's
           house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the
           house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously
           effected.

14:007:012 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him,
           I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself
           for an house of sacrifice.

14:007:013 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
           locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my
           people;

14:007:014 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
           themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
           wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
           their sin, and will heal their land.

14:007:015 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the
           prayer that is made in this place.

14:007:016 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name
           may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be
           there perpetually.

14:007:017 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy
           father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded
           thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;

14:007:018 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I
           have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not
           fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.

14:007:019 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my
           commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and
           serve other gods, and worship them;

14:007:020 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I
           have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for
           my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a
           proverb and a byword among all nations.

14:007:021 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to
           every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath
           the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?

14:007:022 And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of
           their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of
           Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and
           served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon
           them.

14:008:001 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein
           Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,

14:008:002 That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon
           built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.

14:008:003 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.

14:008:004 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store
           cities, which he built in Hamath.

14:008:005 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,
           fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

14:008:006 And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and
           all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and
           all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in
           Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.

14:008:007 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
           Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
           Jebusites, which were not of Israel,

14:008:008 But of their children, who were left after them in the land,
           whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon
           make to pay tribute until this day.

14:008:009 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for
           his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains,
           and captains of his chariots and horsemen.

14:008:010 And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two
           hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.

14:008:011 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city
           of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he
           said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of
           Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the
           LORD hath come.

14:008:012 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the
           altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,

14:008:013 Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the
           commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
           and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the
           feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in
           the feast of tabernacles.

14:008:014 And he appointed, according to the order of David his father,
           the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites
           to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests,
           as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their
           courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God
           commanded.

14:008:015 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto
           the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning
           the treasures.

14:008:016 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
           foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was
           finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.

14:008:017 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side
           in the land of Edom.

14:008:018 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
           servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the
           servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and
           fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

14:009:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she
           came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a
           very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in
           abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to
           Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.

14:009:002 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing
           hid from Solomon which he told her not.

14:009:003 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon,
           and the house that he had built,

14:009:004 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
           and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his
           cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he
           went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit
           in her.

14:009:005 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard
           in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

14:009:006 Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine
           eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness
           of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame
           that I heard.

14:009:007 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which
           stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

14:009:008 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set
           thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because
           thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore
           made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.

14:009:009 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
           and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither
           was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king
           Solomon.

14:009:010 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
           which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and
           precious stones.

14:009:011 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of
           the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries
           for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land
           of Judah.

14:009:012 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
           whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto
           the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she
           and her servants.

14:009:013 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
           six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

14:009:014 Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the
           kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and
           silver to Solomon.

14:009:015 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
           hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.

14:009:016 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three
           hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put
           them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

14:009:017 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
           it with pure gold.

14:009:018 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of
           gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each
           side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the
           stays:

14:009:019 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
           upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any
           kingdom.

14:009:020 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and
           all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of
           pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted
           of in the days of Solomon.

14:009:021 For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of
           Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish
           bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

14:009:022 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches
           and wisdom.

14:009:023 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,
           to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.

14:009:024 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
           vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and
           mules, a rate year by year.

14:009:025 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots,
           and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot
           cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

14:009:026 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
           land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

14:009:027 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar
           trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains
           in abundance.

14:009:028 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of
           all lands.

14:009:029 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they
           not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the
           prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo
           the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

14:009:030 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

14:009:031 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the
           city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
           stead.

14:010:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel
           come to make him king.

14:010:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
           in Egypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the
           king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

14:010:003 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came
           and spake to Rehoboam, saying,

14:010:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou
           somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy
           yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.

14:010:005 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days.
           And the people departed.

14:010:006 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
           before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What
           counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?

14:010:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this
           people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they
           will be thy servants for ever.

14:010:008 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and
           took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him,
           that stood before him.

14:010:009 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
           answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease
           somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?

14:010:010 And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto
           him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto
           thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
           somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My
           little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

14:010:011 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put
           more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I
           will chastise you with scorpions.

14:010:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
           day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third
           day.

14:010:013 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
           the counsel of the old men,

14:010:014 And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying,
           My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my
           father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with
           scorpions.

14:010:015 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was
           of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake
           by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of
           Nebat.

14:010:016 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
           them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have
           we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse:
           every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to
           thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.

14:010:017 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
           Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

14:010:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and
           the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.
           But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to
           flee to Jerusalem.

14:010:019 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

14:011:001 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the
           house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand
           chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that
           he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.

14:011:002 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God,
           saying,

14:011:003 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to
           all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

14:011:004 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
           your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing
           is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and
           returned from going against Jeroboam.

14:011:005 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence
           in Judah.

14:011:006 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

14:011:007 And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,

14:011:008 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

14:011:009 And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

14:011:010 And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in
           Benjamin fenced cities.

14:011:011 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them,
           and store of victual, and of oil and wine.

14:011:012 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made
           them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.

14:011:013 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel
           resorted to him out of all their coasts.

14:011:014 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
           came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had
           cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the
           LORD:

14:011:015 And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the
           devils, and for the calves which he had made.

14:011:016 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set
           their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem,
           to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.

14:011:017 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
           the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they
           walked in the way of David and Solomon.

14:011:018 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the
           son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the
           son of Jesse;

14:011:019 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.

14:011:020 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
           bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.

14:011:021 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all
           his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and
           threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and
           threescore daughters.)

14:011:022 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be
           ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.

14:011:023 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children
           throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every
           fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he
           desired many wives.

14:012:001 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the
           kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of
           the LORD, and all Israel with him.

14:012:002 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
           Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they
           had transgressed against the LORD,

14:012:003 With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand
           horsemen: and the people were without number that came with
           him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the
           Ethiopians.

14:012:004 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and
           came to Jerusalem.

14:012:005 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes
           of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of
           Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have
           forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of
           Shishak.

14:012:006 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled
           themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.

14:012:007 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word
           of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled
           themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will
           grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured
           out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

14:012:008 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
           service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

14:012:009 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took
           away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures
           of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the
           shields of gold which Solomon had made.

14:012:010 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
           committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that
           kept the entrance of the king's house.

14:012:011 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the
           guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the
           guard chamber.

14:012:012 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from
           him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in
           Judah things went well.

14:012:013 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and
           reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he
           began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,
           the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of
           Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was
           Naamah an Ammonitess.

14:012:014 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the
           LORD.

14:012:015 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
           in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer
           concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam
           and Jeroboam continually.

14:012:016 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
           city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

14:013:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to
           reign over Judah.

14:013:002 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
           was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was
           war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

14:013:003 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men
           of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also
           set the battle in array against him with eight hundred
           thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.

14:013:004 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
           Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;

14:013:005 Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the
           kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his
           sons by a covenant of salt?

14:013:006 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son
           of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.

14:013:007 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of
           Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the
           son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and
           could not withstand them.

14:013:008 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the
           hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and
           there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for
           gods.

14:013:009 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of
           Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the
           manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh
           to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the
           same may be a priest of them that are no gods.

14:013:010 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken
           him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the
           sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:

14:013:011 And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening
           burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set
           they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold
           with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the
           charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.

14:013:012 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his
           priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O
           children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your
           fathers; for ye shall not prosper.

14:013:013 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them:
           so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.

14:013:014 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
           behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded
           with the trumpets.

14:013:015 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
           shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all
           Israel before Abijah and Judah.

14:013:016 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God
           delivered them into their hand.

14:013:017 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so
           there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen
           men.

14:013:018 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
           and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon
           the LORD God of their fathers.

14:013:019 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
           Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns
           thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.

14:013:020 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
           Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.

14:013:021 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
           twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

14:013:022 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
           sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

14:014:001 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
           city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his
           days the land was quiet ten years.

14:014:002 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the
           LORD his God:

14:014:003 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high
           places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:

14:014:004 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and
           to do the law and the commandment.

14:014:005 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high
           places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.

14:014:006 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest,
           and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given
           him rest.

14:014:007 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and
           make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the
           land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our
           God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every
           side. So they built and prospered.

14:014:008 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out
           of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that
           bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore
           thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.

14:014:009 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an
           host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and
           came unto Mareshah.

14:014:010 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in
           array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

14:014:011 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
           nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them
           that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on
           thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD,
           thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.

14:014:012 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
           and the Ethiopians fled.

14:014:013 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
           Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not
           recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD,
           and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.

14:014:014 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear
           of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities;
           for there was exceeding much spoil in them.

14:014:015 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep
           and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

14:015:001 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

14:015:002 And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me,
           Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while
           ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you;
           but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.

14:015:003 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God,
           and without a teaching priest, and without law.

14:015:004 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of
           Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.

14:015:005 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out,
           nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the
           inhabitants of the countries.

14:015:006 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God
           did vex them with all adversity.

14:015:007 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for
           your work shall be rewarded.

14:015:008 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
           prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols
           out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
           cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the
           altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.

14:015:009 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with
           them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they
           fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the
           LORD his God was with him.

14:015:010 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
           month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

14:015:011 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil
           which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand
           sheep.

14:015:012 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their
           fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

14:015:013 That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be
           put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

14:015:014 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with
           shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.

14:015:015 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with
           all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and
           he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.

14:015:016 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
           removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in
           a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt
           it at the brook Kidron.

14:015:017 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
           nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

14:015:018 And he brought into the house of God the things that his
           father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated,
           silver, and gold, and vessels.

14:015:019 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
           the reign of Asa.

14:016:001 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king
           of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the
           intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of
           Judah.

14:016:002 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of
           the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to
           Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

14:016:003 There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my
           father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and
           gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he
           may depart from me.

14:016:004 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
           his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon,
           and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

14:016:005 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off
           building of Ramah, and let his work cease.

14:016:006 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
           stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was
           building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

14:016:007 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
           and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of
           Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the
           host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.

14:016:008 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
           many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on
           the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.

14:016:009 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
           earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose
           heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly:
           therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.

14:016:010 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison
           house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing.
           And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.

14:016:011 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are
           written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

14:016:012 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
           in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his
           disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.

14:016:013 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and
           fortieth year of his reign.

14:016:014 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made
           for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed
           which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices
           prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great
           burning for him.

14:017:001 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
           himself against Israel.

14:017:002 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and
           set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of
           Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.

14:017:003 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the
           first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;

14:017:004 But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his
           commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

14:017:005 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all
           Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and
           honour in abundance.

14:017:006 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover
           he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.

14:017:007 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes,
           even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to
           Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

14:017:008 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah,
           and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and
           Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them
           Elishama and Jehoram, priests.

14:017:009 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the
           LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of
           Judah, and taught the people.

14:017:010 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the
           lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war
           against Jehoshaphat.

14:017:011 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
           tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven
           thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven
           hundred he goats.

14:017:012 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
           castles, and cities of store.

14:017:013 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men
           of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.

14:017:014 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
           their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the
           chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred
           thousand.

14:017:015 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
           hundred and fourscore thousand.

14:017:016 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
           offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred
           thousand mighty men of valour.

14:017:017 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him
           armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.

14:017:018 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and
           fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.

14:017:019 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in
           the fenced cities throughout all Judah.

14:018:001 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
           affinity with Ahab.

14:018:002 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And
           Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the
           people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with
           him to Ramothgilead.

14:018:003 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
           Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I
           am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be
           with thee in the war.

14:018:004 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
           thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

14:018:005 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets
           four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to
           Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
           up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.

14:018:006 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
           besides, that we might enquire of him?

14:018:007 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
           man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for
           he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is
           Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the
           king say so.

14:018:008 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and
           said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

14:018:009 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat
           either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they
           sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria;
           and all the prophets prophesied before them.

14:018:010 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
           and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push
           Syria until they be consumed.

14:018:011 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
           Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
           the hand of the king.

14:018:012 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
           saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the
           king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be
           like one of their's, and speak thou good.

14:018:013 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,
           that will I speak.

14:018:014 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
           Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I
           forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be
           delivered into your hand.

14:018:015 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee
           that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the
           LORD?

14:018:016 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the
           mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said,
           These have no master; let them return therefore every man to
           his house in peace.

14:018:017 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
           thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?

14:018:018 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the
           LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven
           standing on his right hand and on his left.

14:018:019 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that
           he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying
           after this manner, and another saying after that manner.

14:018:020 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
           said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him,
           Wherewith?

14:018:021 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth
           of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him,
           and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.

14:018:022 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
           mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
           against thee.

14:018:023 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote
           Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of
           the LORD from me to speak unto thee?

14:018:024 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou
           shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

14:018:025 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
           back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
           son;

14:018:026 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
           and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
           affliction, until I return in peace.

14:018:027 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath
           not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye
           people.

14:018:028 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
           up to Ramothgilead.

14:018:029 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
           myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy
           robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went
           to the battle.

14:018:030 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the
           chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small
           or great, save only with the king of Israel.

14:018:031 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
           Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel.
           Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat
           cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to
           depart from him.

14:018:032 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
           perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back
           again from pursuing him.

14:018:033 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
           of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said
           to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me
           out of the host; for I am wounded.

14:018:034 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel
           stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the
           even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

14:019:001 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
           peace to Jerusalem.

14:019:002 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
           said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and
           love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee
           from before the LORD.

14:019:003 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou
           hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared
           thine heart to seek God.

14:019:004 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again
           through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and
           brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.

14:019:005 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities
           of Judah, city by city,

14:019:006 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not
           for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.

14:019:007 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed
           and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor
           respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.

14:019:008 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and
           of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for
           the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they
           returned to Jerusalem.

14:019:009 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of
           the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

14:019:010 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
           dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and
           commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them
           that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come
           upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not
           trespass.

14:019:011 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all
           matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the
           ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also
           the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously,
           and the LORD shall be with the good.

14:020:001 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab,
           and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the
           Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

14:020:002 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There
           cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on
           this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which
           is Engedi.

14:020:003 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and
           proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

14:020:004 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the
           LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek
           the LORD.

14:020:005 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and
           Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,

14:020:006 And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in
           heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the
           heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so
           that none is able to withstand thee?

14:020:007 Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of
           this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed
           of Abraham thy friend for ever?

14:020:008 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary
           therein for thy name, saying,

14:020:009 If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or
           pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy
           presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee
           in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.

14:020:010 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount
           Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came
           out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and
           destroyed them not;

14:020:011 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of
           thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

14:020:012 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
           against this great company that cometh against us; neither
           know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.

14:020:013 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,
           their wives, and their children.

14:020:014 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah,
           the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons
           of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the
           congregation;

14:020:015 And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of
           Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto
           you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great
           multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.

14:020:016 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the
           cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook,
           before the wilderness of Jeruel.

14:020:017 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves,
           stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O
           Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go
           out against them: for the LORD will be with you.

14:020:018 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground:
           and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the
           LORD, worshipping the LORD.

14:020:019 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
           children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of
           Israel with a loud voice on high.

14:020:020 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
           wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood
           and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem;
           Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established;
           believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.

14:020:021 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed
           singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of
           holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise
           the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.

14:020:022 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set
           ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount
           Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.

14:020:023 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
           inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them:
           and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
           every one helped to destroy another.

14:020:024 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
           they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead
           bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.

14:020:025 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the
           spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches
           with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped
           off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they
           were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.

14:020:026 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley
           of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the
           name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah,
           unto this day.

14:020:027 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
           Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem
           with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their
           enemies.

14:020:028 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
           trumpets unto the house of the LORD.

14:020:029 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those
           countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against
           the enemies of Israel.

14:020:030 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him
           rest round about.

14:020:031 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five
           years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and
           five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the
           daughter of Shilhi.

14:020:032 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not
           from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.

14:020:033 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the
           people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their
           fathers.

14:020:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,
           behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of
           Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

14:020:035 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
           Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:

14:020:036 And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to
           Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.

14:020:037 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
           Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with
           Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were
           broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

14:021:001 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
           his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned
           in his stead.

14:021:002 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and
           Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and
           Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of
           Israel.

14:021:003 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
           and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the
           kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.

14:021:004 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
           strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the
           sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.

14:021:005 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign,
           and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

14:021:006 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did
           the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife:
           and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.

14:021:007 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because
           of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he
           promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.

14:021:008 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
           Judah, and made themselves a king.

14:021:009 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots
           with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites
           which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.

14:021:010 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto
           this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his
           hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.

14:021:011 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and
           caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and
           compelled Judah thereto.

14:021:012 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet,
           saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because
           thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father,
           nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

14:021:013 But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast
           made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring,
           like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast
           slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better
           than thyself:

14:021:014 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people,
           and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:

14:021:015 And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels,
           until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by
           day.

14:021:016 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
           Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the
           Ethiopians:

14:021:017 And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried
           away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and
           his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son
           left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

14:021:018 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
           incurable disease.

14:021:019 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of
           two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so
           he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for
           him, like the burning of his fathers.

14:021:020 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
           reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being
           desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not
           in the sepulchres of the kings.

14:022:001 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son
           king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the
           Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the
           son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.

14:022:002 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign,
           and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
           was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.

14:022:003 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his
           mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.

14:022:004 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house
           of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his
           father to his destruction.

14:022:005 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the
           son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria
           at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.

14:022:006 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
           which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king
           of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went
           down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was
           sick.

14:022:007 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram:
           for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu
           the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the
           house of Ahab.

14:022:008 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment
           upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and
           the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to
           Ahaziah, he slew them.

14:022:009 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
           Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain
           him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of
           Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the
           house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.

14:022:010 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
           dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house
           of Judah.

14:022:011 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
           of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were
           slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So
           Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of
           Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid
           him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.

14:022:012 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
           Athaliah reigned over the land.

14:023:001 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and
           took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and
           Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and
           Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
           into covenant with him.

14:023:002 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of
           all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of
           Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

14:023:003 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
           house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son
           shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.

14:023:004 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you
           entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites,
           shall be porters of the doors;

14:023:005 And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third
           part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall
           be in the courts of the house of the LORD.

14:023:006 But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the
           priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go
           in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch
           of the LORD.

14:023:007 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
           with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into
           the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king
           when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.

14:023:008 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
           Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men
           that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go
           out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the
           courses.

14:023:009 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
           hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king
           David's, which were in the house of God.

14:023:010 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
           hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of
           the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king
           round about.

14:023:011 Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the
           crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And
           Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the
           king.

14:023:012 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
           praising the king, she came to the people into the house of
           the LORD:

14:023:013 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at
           the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king:
           and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with
           trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and
           such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes,
           and said, Treason, Treason.

14:023:014 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
           that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her
           forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain
           with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house
           of the LORD.

14:023:015 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the
           entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her
           there.

14:023:016 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
           people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's
           people.

14:023:017 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
           down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew
           Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

14:023:018 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD
           by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had
           distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt
           offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses,
           with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.

14:023:019 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,
           that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.

14:023:020 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
           governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and
           brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they
           came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the
           king upon the throne of the kingdom.

14:023:021 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was
           quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

14:024:001 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
           Zibiah of Beersheba.

14:024:002 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
           all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

14:024:003 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
           daughters.

14:024:004 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to
           repair the house of the LORD.

14:024:005 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said
           to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all
           Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to
           year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites
           hastened it not.

14:024:006 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,
           Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of
           Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the
           commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the
           congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?

14:024:007 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the
           house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house
           of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.

14:024:008 And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it
           without at the gate of the house of the LORD.

14:024:009 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to
           bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of
           God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.

14:024:010 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought
           in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.

14:024:011 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
           unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when
           they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the
           high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it,
           and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day,
           and gathered money in abundance.

14:024:012 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of
           the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and
           carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as
           wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.

14:024:013 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them,
           and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened
           it.

14:024:014 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the
           money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels
           for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to
           offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And
           they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD
           continually all the days of Jehoiada.

14:024:015 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
           hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.

14:024:016 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
           because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and
           toward his house.

14:024:017 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
           made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

14:024:018 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and
           served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and
           Jerusalem for this their trespass.

14:024:019 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the
           LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give
           ear.

14:024:020 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
           the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them,
           Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the
           LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the
           LORD, he hath also forsaken you.

14:024:021 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
           the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the
           LORD.

14:024:022 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
           his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he
           died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.

14:024:023 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of
           Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and
           Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from
           among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king
           of Damascus.

14:024:024 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
           and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand,
           because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So
           they executed judgment against Joash.

14:024:025 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
           great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for
           the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on
           his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of
           David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.

14:024:026 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son
           of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a
           Moabitess.

14:024:027 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid
           upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they
           are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah
           his son reigned in his stead.

14:025:001 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
           and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his
           mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

14:025:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but
           not with a perfect heart.

14:025:003 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
           that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.

14:025:004 But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in
           the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded,
           saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither
           shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall
           die for his own sin.

14:025:005 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them
           captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according
           to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and
           Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and
           above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able
           to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.

14:025:006 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
           Israel for an hundred talents of silver.

14:025:007 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not
           the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with
           Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.

14:025:008 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God
           shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to
           help, and to cast down.

14:025:009 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for
           the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?
           And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee
           much more than this.

14:025:010 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to
           him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger
           was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in
           great anger.

14:025:011 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people,
           and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of
           Seir ten thousand.

14:025:012 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
           carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock,
           and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all
           were broken in pieces.

14:025:013 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that
           they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of
           Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three
           thousand of them, and took much spoil.

14:025:014 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
           slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the
           children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed
           down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.

14:025:015 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah,
           and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast
           thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not
           deliver their own people out of thine hand?

14:025:016 And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said
           unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why
           shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said,
           I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou
           hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.

14:025:017 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the
           son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,
           Come, let us see one another in the face.

14:025:018 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
           saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
           was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
           and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
           trode down the thistle.

14:025:019 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine
           heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why
           shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall,
           even thou, and Judah with thee?

14:025:020 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might
           deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they
           sought after the gods of Edom.

14:025:021 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another
           in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at
           Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

14:025:022 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
           every man to his tent.

14:025:023 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the
           son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought
           him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from
           the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

14:025:024 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
           that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the
           treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned
           to Samaria.

14:025:025 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
           death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

14:025:026 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,
           are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and
           Israel?

14:025:027 Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following
           the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and
           he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and
           slew him there.

14:025:028 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his
           fathers in the city of Judah.

14:026:001 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen
           years old, and made him king in the room of his father
           Amaziah.

14:026:002 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
           slept with his fathers.

14:026:003 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
           reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
           also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.

14:026:004 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his father Amaziah did.

14:026:005 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had
           understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought
           the LORD, God made him to prosper.

14:026:006 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and
           brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the
           wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the
           Philistines.

14:026:007 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the
           Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.

14:026:008 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
           abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened
           himself exceedingly.

14:026:009 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,
           and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and
           fortified them.

14:026:010 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
           he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the
           plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains,
           and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.

14:026:011 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
           war by bands, according to the number of their account by the
           hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the
           hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.

14:026:012 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
           of valour were two thousand and six hundred.

14:026:013 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and
           seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty
           power, to help the king against the enemy.

14:026:014 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,
           and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings
           to cast stones.

14:026:015 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to
           be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and
           great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he
           was marvellously helped, till he was strong.

14:026:016 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
           destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and
           went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the
           altar of incense.

14:026:017 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him
           fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:

14:026:018 And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It
           appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the
           LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are
           consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou
           hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the
           LORD God.

14:026:019 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
           incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy
           even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house
           of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.

14:026:020 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
           him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they
           thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go
           out, because the LORD had smitten him.

14:026:021 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
           dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off
           from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the
           king's house, judging the people of the land.

14:026:022 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
           the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.

14:026:023 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
           fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the
           kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son
           reigned in his stead.

14:027:001 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
           and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
           also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.

14:027:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he
           entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did
           yet corruptly.

14:027:003 He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the
           wall of Ophel he built much.

14:027:004 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
           forests he built castles and towers.

14:027:005 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
           against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year
           an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of
           wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of
           Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.

14:027:006 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before
           the LORD his God.

14:027:007 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
           ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel
           and Judah.

14:027:008 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
           reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

14:027:009 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
           city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

14:028:001 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which
           was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:

14:028:002 For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made
           also molten images for Baalim.

14:028:003 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
           and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of
           the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of
           Israel.

14:028:004 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and
           on the hills, and under every green tree.

14:028:005 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
           king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great
           multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And
           he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who
           smote him with a great slaughter.

14:028:006 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and
           twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men;
           because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.

14:028:007 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's
           son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that
           was next to the king.

14:028:008 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their
           brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and
           took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to
           Samaria.

14:028:009 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and
           he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said
           unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was
           wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and
           ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.

14:028:010 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
           Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there
           not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?

14:028:011 Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which
           ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath
           of the LORD is upon you.

14:028:012 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
           the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and
           Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai,
           stood up against them that came from the war,

14:028:013 And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither:
           for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye
           intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our
           trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.

14:028:014 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
           princes and all the congregation.

14:028:015 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
           captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among
           them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat
           and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of
           them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm
           trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.

14:028:016 At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
           help him.

14:028:017 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried
           away captives.

14:028:018 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low
           country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh,
           and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages
           thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and
           the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.

14:028:019 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
           for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the
           LORD.

14:028:020 And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
           distressed him, but strengthened him not.

14:028:021 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and
           out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it
           unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.

14:028:022 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more
           against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.

14:028:023 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:
           and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,
           therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But
           they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.

14:028:024 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God,
           and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up
           the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in
           every corner of Jerusalem.

14:028:025 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
           incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of
           his fathers.

14:028:026 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
           behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and
           Israel.

14:028:027 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
           city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the
           sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son
           reigned in his stead.

14:029:001 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,
           and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his
           mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

14:029:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
           according to all that David his father had done.

14:029:003 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened
           the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.

14:029:004 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered
           them together into the east street,

14:029:005 And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now
           yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your
           fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.

14:029:006 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil
           in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and
           have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD,
           and turned their backs.

14:029:007 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
           lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings
           in the holy place unto the God of Israel.

14:029:008 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem,
           and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to
           hissing, as ye see with your eyes.

14:029:009 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons
           and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.

14:029:010 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God
           of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.

14:029:011 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
           stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister
           unto him, and burn incense.

14:029:012 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
           son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons
           of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of
           Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and
           Eden the son of Joah:

14:029:013 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the
           sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:

14:029:014 And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons
           of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.

14:029:015 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves,
           and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the
           words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.

14:029:016 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
           LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that
           they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the
           house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out
           abroad into the brook Kidron.

14:029:017 Now they began on the first day of the first month to
           sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the
           porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in
           eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they
           made an end.

14:029:018 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
           cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt
           offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread
           table, with all the vessels thereof.

14:029:019 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did
           cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and
           sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the
           LORD.

14:029:020 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
           the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.

14:029:021 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
           lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom,
           and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the
           priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the
           LORD.

14:029:022 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the
           blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had
           killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they
           killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the
           altar.

14:029:023 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering
           before the king and the congregation; and they laid their
           hands upon them:

14:029:024 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with
           their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all
           Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the
           sin offering should be made for all Israel.

14:029:025 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
           with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment
           of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet:
           for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.

14:029:026 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
           priests with the trumpets.

14:029:027 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
           altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD
           began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments
           ordained by David king of Israel.

14:029:028 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
           the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt
           offering was finished.

14:029:029 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all
           that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.

14:029:030 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the
           Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David,
           and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness,
           and they bowed their heads and worshipped.

14:029:031 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
           yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and
           thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the
           congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as
           many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.

14:029:032 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
           brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and
           two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the
           LORD.

14:029:033 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
           thousand sheep.

14:029:034 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
           the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did
           help them, till the work was ended, and until the other
           priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more
           upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.

14:029:035 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat
           of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every
           burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was
           set in order.

14:029:036 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had
           prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

14:030:001 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters
           also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the
           house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the
           LORD God of Israel.

14:030:002 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
           congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second
           month.

14:030:003 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests
           had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the
           people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.

14:030:004 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.

14:030:005 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout
           all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come
           to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem:
           for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was
           written.

14:030:006 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his
           princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the
           commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn
           again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he
           will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the
           hand of the kings of Assyria.

14:030:007 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
           trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who
           therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.

14:030:008 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
           yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which
           he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that
           the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.

14:030:009 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
           children shall find compassion before them that lead them
           captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the
           LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away
           his face from you, if ye return unto him.

14:030:010 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
           Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them
           to scorn, and mocked them.

14:030:011 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun
           humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.

14:030:012 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
           the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of
           the LORD.

14:030:013 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
           of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great
           congregation.

14:030:014 And they arose and took away the altars that were in
           Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and
           cast them into the brook Kidron.

14:030:015 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
           second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed,
           and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings
           into the house of the LORD.

14:030:016 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to
           the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the
           blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.

14:030:017 For there were many in the congregation that were not
           sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the
           killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to
           sanctify them unto the LORD.

14:030:018 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
           Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves,
           yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.
           But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon
           every one

14:030:019 That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his
           fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the
           purification of the sanctuary.

14:030:020 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.

14:030:021 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
           the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness:
           and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day,
           singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.

14:030:022 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that
           taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat
           throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and
           making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.

14:030:023 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
           and they kept other seven days with gladness.

14:030:024 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
           thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes
           gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand
           sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.

14:030:025 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
           Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and
           the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that
           dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

14:030:026 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
           Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like
           in Jerusalem.

14:030:027 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and
           their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy
           dwelling place, even unto heaven.

14:031:001 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present
           went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in
           pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high
           places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in
           Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed
           them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man
           to his possession, into their own cities.

14:031:002 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the
           Levites after their courses, every man according to his
           service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for
           peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to
           praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.

14:031:003 He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the
           burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt
           offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for
           the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the
           law of the LORD.

14:031:004 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to
           give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they
           might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.

14:031:005 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
           Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and
           oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the
           tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.

14:031:006 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in
           the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen
           and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated
           unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.

14:031:007 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the
           heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.

14:031:008 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
           blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.

14:031:009 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
           concerning the heaps.

14:031:010 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered
           him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings
           into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and
           have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and
           that which is left is this great store.

14:031:011 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of
           the LORD; and they prepared them,

14:031:012 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated
           things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler,
           and Shimei his brother was the next.

14:031:013 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
           and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and
           Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei
           his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and
           Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

14:031:014 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
           east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute
           the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.

14:031:015 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and
           Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the
           priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by
           courses, as well to the great as to the small:

14:031:016 Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and
           upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of
           the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges
           according to their courses;

14:031:017 Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their
           fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in
           their charges by their courses;

14:031:018 And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives,
           and their sons, and their daughters, through all the
           congregation: for in their set office they sanctified
           themselves in holiness:

14:031:019 Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the
           fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city,
           the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all
           the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by
           genealogies among the Levites.

14:031:020 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that
           which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.

14:031:021 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
           God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God,
           he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

14:032:001 After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib
           king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped
           against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for
           himself.

14:032:002 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he
           was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

14:032:003 He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop
           the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and
           they did help him.

14:032:004 So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all
           the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the
           land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find
           much water?

14:032:005 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that
           was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall
           without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made
           darts and shields in abundance.

14:032:006 And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
           together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and
           spake comfortably to them, saying,

14:032:007 Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the
           king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him:
           for there be more with us than with him:

14:032:008 With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God
           to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested
           themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

14:032:009 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants
           to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and
           all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto
           all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,

14:032:010 Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust,
           that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?

14:032:011 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die
           by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall
           deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

14:032:012 Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his
           altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall
           worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?

14:032:013 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the
           people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those
           lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?

14:032:014 Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my
           fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out
           of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out
           of mine hand?

14:032:015 Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you
           on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any
           nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine
           hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall
           your God deliver you out of mine hand?

14:032:016 And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and
           against his servant Hezekiah.

14:032:017 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and
           to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of
           other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand,
           so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of
           mine hand.

14:032:018 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the
           people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them,
           and to trouble them; that they might take the city.

14:032:019 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the
           gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the
           hands of man.

14:032:020 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah
           the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.

14:032:021 And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men
           of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the
           king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own
           land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they
           that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the
           sword.

14:032:022 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
           from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the
           hand of all other, and guided them on every side.

14:032:023 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and
           presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified
           in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.

14:032:024 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto
           the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.

14:032:025 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
           unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was
           wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

14:032:026 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
           heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the
           wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

14:032:027 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
           himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious
           stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of
           pleasant jewels;

14:032:028 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil;
           and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

14:032:029 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
           herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.

14:032:030 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of
           Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the
           city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

14:032:031 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
           Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was
           done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know
           all that was in his heart.

14:032:032 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness,
           behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet,
           the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and
           Israel.

14:032:033 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
           the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all
           Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his
           death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

14:033:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:

14:033:002 But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like
           unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast
           out before the children of Israel.

14:033:003 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father
           had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made
           groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served
           them.

14:033:004 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the
           LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.

14:033:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
           courts of the house of the LORD.

14:033:006 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the
           valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used
           enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar
           spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of
           the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

14:033:007 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
           house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon
           his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen
           before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

14:033:008 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of
           the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they
           will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according
           to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the
           hand of Moses.

14:033:009 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to
           err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had
           destroyed before the children of Israel.

14:033:010 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
           would not hearken.

14:033:011 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host
           of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns,
           and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

14:033:012 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God,
           and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

14:033:013 And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard
           his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his
           kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.

14:033:014 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on
           the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in
           at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up
           a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced
           cities of Judah.

14:033:015 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the
           house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the
           mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast
           them out of the city.

14:033:016 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon
           peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to
           serve the LORD God of Israel.

14:033:017 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high
           places, yet unto the LORD their God only.

14:033:018 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
           God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name
           of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the
           book of the kings of Israel.

14:033:019 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
           sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high
           places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was
           humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the
           seers.

14:033:020 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
           own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

14:033:021 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
           reigned two years in Jerusalem.

14:033:022 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
           did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the
           carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served
           them;

14:033:023 And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his
           father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.

14:033:024 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his
           own house.

14:033:025 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
           against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
           son king in his stead.

14:034:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.

14:034:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
           walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither
           to the right hand, nor to the left.

14:034:003 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,
           he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the
           twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the
           high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the
           molten images.

14:034:004 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and
           the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the
           groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake
           in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the
           graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

14:034:005 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and
           cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

14:034:006 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and
           Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

14:034:007 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had
           beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the
           idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to
           Jerusalem.

14:034:008 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged
           the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah,
           and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of
           Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.

14:034:009 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered
           the money that was brought into the house of God, which the
           Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of
           Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of
           all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.

14:034:010 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
           oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the
           workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and
           amend the house:

14:034:011 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
           stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which
           the kings of Judah had destroyed.

14:034:012 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them
           were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari;
           and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to
           set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill
           of instruments of musick.

14:034:013 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers
           of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of
           the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.

14:034:014 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the
           house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law
           of the LORD given by Moses.

14:034:015 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have
           found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
           Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

14:034:016 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king
           word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy
           servants, they do it.

14:034:017 And they have gathered together the money that was found in
           the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of
           the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.

14:034:018 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the
           priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the
           king.

14:034:019 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
           law, that he rent his clothes.

14:034:020 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
           and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah
           a servant of the king's, saying,

14:034:021 Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in
           Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is
           found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out
           upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the
           LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.

14:034:022 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to
           Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath,
           the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
           Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that
           effect.

14:034:023 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
           ye the man that sent you to me,

14:034:024 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
           place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses
           that are written in the book which they have read before the
           king of Judah:

14:034:025 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
           other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
           works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out
           upon this place, and shall not be quenched.

14:034:026 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the
           LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
           Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;

14:034:027 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself
           before God, when thou heardest his words against this place,
           and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself
           before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I
           have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.

14:034:028 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
           gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see
           all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the
           inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.

14:034:029 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of
           Judah and Jerusalem.

14:034:030 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
           men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the
           priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small:
           and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the
           covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.

14:034:031 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before
           the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his
           commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all
           his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the
           covenant which are written in this book.

14:034:032 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin
           to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according
           to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

14:034:033 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
           countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made
           all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the
           LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from
           following the LORD, the God of their fathers.

14:035:001 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem:
           and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
           first month.

14:035:002 And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them
           to the service of the house of the LORD,

14:035:003 And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were
           holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which
           Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall
           not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your
           God, and his people Israel,

14:035:004 And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after
           your courses, according to the writing of David king of
           Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.

14:035:005 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
           families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after
           the division of the families of the Levites.

14:035:006 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare
           your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the
           LORD by the hand of Moses.

14:035:007 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids,
           all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to
           the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks:
           these were of the king's substance.

14:035:008 And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the
           priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel,
           rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the
           passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle
           and three hundred oxen.

14:035:009 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
           Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave
           unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small
           cattle, and five hundred oxen.

14:035:010 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
           place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the
           king's commandment.

14:035:011 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the
           blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.

14:035:012 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
           according to the divisions of the families of the people, to
           offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses.
           And so did they with the oxen.

14:035:013 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the
           ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and
           in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all
           the people.

14:035:014 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the
           priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in
           offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore
           the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the
           sons of Aaron.

14:035:015 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place,
           according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman,
           and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every
           gate; they might not depart from their service; for their
           brethren the Levites prepared for them.

14:035:016 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to
           keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar
           of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.

14:035:017 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover
           at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.

14:035:018 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the
           days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of
           Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests,
           and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present,
           and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

14:035:019 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this
           passover kept.

14:035:020 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho
           king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by
           Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.

14:035:021 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with
           thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day,
           but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded
           me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is
           with me, that he destroy thee not.

14:035:022 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but
           disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened
           not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to
           fight in the valley of Megiddo.

14:035:023 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
           servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

14:035:024 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put
           him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to
           Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the
           sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned
           for Josiah.

14:035:025 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and
           the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to
           this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold,
           they are written in the lamentations.

14:035:026 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness,
           according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,

14:035:027 And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the
           book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

14:036:001 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
           and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.

14:036:002 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
           reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

14:036:003 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned
           the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.

14:036:004 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
           and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho
           took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.

14:036:005 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
           reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did
           that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.

14:036:006 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound
           him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

14:036:007 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the
           LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.

14:036:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations
           which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they
           are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and
           Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

14:036:009 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
           reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did
           that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.

14:036:010 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and
           brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house
           of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and
           Jerusalem.

14:036:011 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
           and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

14:036:012 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his
           God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet
           speaking from the mouth of the LORD.

14:036:013 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made
           him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his
           heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.

14:036:014 Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,
           transgressed very much after all the abominations of the
           heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had
           hallowed in Jerusalem.

14:036:015 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his
           messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had
           compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:

14:036:016 But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
           and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose
           against his people, till there was no remedy.

14:036:017 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who
           slew their young men with the sword in the house of their
           sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old
           man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his
           hand.

14:036:018 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and
           the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
           the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.

14:036:019 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
           Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and
           destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.

14:036:020 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
           Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until
           the reign of the kingdom of Persia:

14:036:021 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until
           the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay
           desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.

14:036:022 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
           of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
           accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
           Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his
           kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,

14:036:023 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth
           hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me
           to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is
           there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with
           him, and let him go up.

Book 15        Ezra

15:001:001 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
           of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the
           LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he
           made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it
           also in writing, saying,

15:001:002 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath
           given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me
           to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

15:001:003 Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him,
           and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build
           the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is
           in Jerusalem.

15:001:004 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let
           the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and
           with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for
           the house of God that is in Jerusalem.

15:001:005 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin,
           and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit
           God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which
           is in Jerusalem.

15:001:006 And all they that were about them strengthened their hands
           with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with
           beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was
           willingly offered.

15:001:007 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of
           the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of
           Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;

15:001:008 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of
           Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar,
           the prince of Judah.

15:001:009 And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a
           thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,

15:001:010 Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four
           hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.

15:001:011 All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and
           four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of
           the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto
           Jerusalem.

15:002:001 Now these are the children of the province that went up out of
           the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom
           Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto
           Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one
           unto his city;

15:002:002 Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah,
           Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.
           The number of the men of the people of Israel:

           two.

15:002:052 The children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children
           of Harsha,

15:002:053 The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children
           of Thamah,

15:002:054 The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

15:002:055 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the

15:002:058 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
           were three hundred ninety and two.

15:002:059 And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa,
           Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their
           father's house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:

15:002:060 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children
           of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.

15:002:061 And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah,
           the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a
           wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was
           called after their name:

15:002:062 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
           genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as
           polluted, put from the priesthood.

15:002:063 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
           the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
           and with Thummim.

15:002:064 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
           three hundred and threescore,

15:002:065 Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were
           seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were
           among them two hundred singing men and singing women.

15:002:066 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules,
           two hundred forty and five;

15:002:067 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six
           thousand seven hundred and twenty.

15:002:068 And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the
           house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for
           the house of God to set it up in his place:

15:002:069 They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work
           threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand
           pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.

15:002:070 So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and
           the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in
           their cities, and all Israel in their cities.

15:003:001 And when the seventh month was come, and the children of
           Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves
           together as one man to Jerusalem.

15:003:002 Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the
           priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his
           brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer
           burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses
           the man of God.

15:003:003 And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them
           because of the people of those countries: and they offered
           burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings
           morning and evening.

15:003:004 They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and
           offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the
           custom, as the duty of every day required;

15:003:005 And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of
           the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were
           consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a
           freewill offering unto the LORD.

15:003:006 From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer
           burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the
           temple of the LORD was not yet laid.

15:003:007 They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters;
           and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them
           of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of
           Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of
           Persia.

15:003:008 Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God
           at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of
           Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of
           their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that
           were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed
           the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward
           the work of the house of the LORD.

15:003:009 Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and
           his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the
           workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their
           sons and their brethren the Levites.

15:003:010 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the
           LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and
           the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the
           LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.

15:003:011 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks
           unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for
           ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great
           shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of
           the house of the LORD was laid.

15:003:012 But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers,
           who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the
           foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with
           a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:

15:003:013 So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of
           joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the
           people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar
           off.

15:004:001 Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
           children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God
           of Israel;

15:004:002 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers,
           and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your
           God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of
           Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.

15:004:003 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the
           fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with
           us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together
           will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king
           of Persia hath commanded us.

15:004:004 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people
           of Judah, and troubled them in building,

15:004:005 And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their
           purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the
           reign of Darius king of Persia.

15:004:006 And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,
           wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of
           Judah and Jerusalem.

15:004:007 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath,
           Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king
           of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the
           Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.

15:004:008 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
           against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:

15:004:009 Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and
           the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the
           Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the
           Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites,
           and the Elamites,

15:004:010 And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper
           brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest
           that are on this side the river, and at such a time.

15:004:011 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even
           unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side
           the river, and at such a time.

15:004:012 Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from
           thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious
           and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and
           joined the foundations.

15:004:013 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded,
           and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll,
           tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of
           the kings.

15:004:014 Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it
           was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore
           have we sent and certified the king;

15:004:015 That search may be made in the book of the records of thy
           fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and
           know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto
           kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within
           the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.

15:004:016 We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and
           the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no
           portion on this side the river.

15:004:017 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to
           Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that
           dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace,
           and at such a time.

15:004:018 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before
           me.

15:004:019 And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found
           that this city of old time hath made insurrection against
           kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.

15:004:020 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have
           ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute,
           and custom, was paid unto them.

15:004:021 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that
           this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be
           given from me.

15:004:022 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage
           grow to the hurt of the kings?

15:004:023 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before
           Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they
           went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to
           cease by force and power.

15:004:024 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at
           Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of
           Darius king of Persia.

15:005:001 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son
           of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and
           Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.

15:005:002 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the
           son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is
           at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping
           them.

15:005:003 At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side
           the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said
           thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house,
           and to make up this wall?

15:005:004 Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names
           of the men that make this building?

15:005:005 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that
           they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to
           Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning
           this matter.

15:005:006 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
           river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites,
           which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:

15:005:007 They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto
           Darius the king, all peace.

15:005:008 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of
           Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with
           great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work
           goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.

15:005:009 Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who
           commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?

15:005:010 We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might
           write the names of the men that were the chief of them.

15:005:011 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants
           of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was
           builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel
           builded and set up.

15:005:012 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto
           wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king
           of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and
           carried the people away into Babylon.

15:005:013 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same
           king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.

15:005:014 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
           which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in
           Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those
           did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they
           were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he
           had made governor;

15:005:015 And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the
           temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be
           builded in his place.

15:005:016 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the
           house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even
           until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not
           finished.

15:005:017 Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be
           search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at
           Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the
           king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king
           send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

15:006:001 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the
           house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in
           Babylon.

15:006:002 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the
           province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus
           written:

15:006:003 In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king
           made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let
           the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices,
           and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height
           thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore
           cubits;

15:006:004 With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and
           let the expenses be given out of the king's house:

15:006:005 And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of
           God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which
           is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and
           brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one
           to his place, and place them in the house of God.

15:006:006 Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river,
           Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which
           are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:

15:006:007 Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of
           the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in
           his place.

15:006:008 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of
           these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the
           king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith
           expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.

15:006:009 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and
           rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven,
           wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of
           the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day
           by day without fail:

15:006:010 That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God
           of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.

15:006:011 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this
           word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set
           up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a
           dunghill for this.

15:006:012 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy
           all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter
           and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I
           Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.

15:006:013 Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai,
           and their companions, according to that which Darius the king
           had sent, so they did speedily.

15:006:014 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through
           the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of
           Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the
           commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the
           commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of
           Persia.

15:006:015 And this house was finished on the third day of the month
           Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the
           king.

15:006:016 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and
           the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication
           of this house of God with joy.

15:006:017 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
           bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin
           offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the
           number of the tribes of Israel.

15:006:018 And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites
           in their courses, for the service of God, which is at
           Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.

15:006:019 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
           fourteenth day of the first month.

15:006:020 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of
           them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children
           of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for
           themselves.

15:006:021 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of
           captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them
           from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the
           LORD God of Israel, did eat,

15:006:022 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy:
           for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the
           king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the
           work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

15:007:001 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of
           Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son
           of Hilkiah,

15:007:002 The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,

15:007:003 The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,

15:007:004 The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,

15:007:005 The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
           the son of Aaron the chief priest:

15:007:006 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in
           the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and
           the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of
           the LORD his God upon him.

15:007:007 And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the
           priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters,
           and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of
           Artaxerxes the king.

15:007:008 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the
           seventh year of the king.

15:007:009 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up
           from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he
           to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.

15:007:010 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD,
           and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

15:007:011 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes
           gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the
           words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to
           Israel.

15:007:012 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of
           the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a
           time.

15:007:013 I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of
           his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of
           their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.

15:007:014 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven
           counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem,
           according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand;

15:007:015 And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his
           counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose
           habitation is in Jerusalem,

15:007:016 And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the
           province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people,
           and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their
           God which is in Jerusalem:

15:007:017 That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams,
           lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings,
           and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which
           is in Jerusalem.

15:007:018 And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren,
           to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after
           the will of your God.

15:007:019 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the
           house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of
           Jerusalem.

15:007:020 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God,
           which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the
           king's treasure house.

15:007:021 And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
           treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra
           the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall
           require of you, it be done speedily,

15:007:022 Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures
           of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred
           baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.

15:007:023 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be
           diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why
           should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his
           sons?

15:007:024 Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and
           Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this
           house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute,
           or custom, upon them.

15:007:025 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine
           hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the
           people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of
           thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.

15:007:026 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of
           the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether
           it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of
           goods, or to imprisonment.

15:007:027 Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a
           thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of
           the LORD which is in Jerusalem:

15:007:028 And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his
           counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I
           was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me,
           and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with
           me.

15:008:001 These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the
           genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the
           reign of Artaxerxes the king.

15:008:002 Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar;
           Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.

15:008:003 Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah:
           and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an
           hundred and fifty.

15:008:004 Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and
           with him two hundred males.

15:008:005 Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him
           three hundred males.

15:008:006 Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with
           him fifty males.

15:008:007 And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and
           with him seventy males.

15:008:008 And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael,
           and with him fourscore males.

15:008:009 Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him
           two hundred and eighteen males.

15:008:010 And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with
           him an hundred and threescore males.

15:008:011 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with
           him twenty and eight males.

15:008:012 And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and
           with him an hundred and ten males.

15:008:013 And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these,
           Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore
           males.

15:008:014 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
           seventy males.

15:008:015 And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to
           Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed
           the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons
           of Levi.

15:008:016 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
           Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and
           for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib,
           and for Elnathan, men of understanding.

15:008:017 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the
           place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto
           Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place
           Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the
           house of our God.

15:008:018 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man
           of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the
           son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren,
           eighteen;

15:008:019 And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari,
           his brethren and their sons, twenty;

15:008:020 Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had
           appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and
           twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.

15:008:021 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we
           might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right
           way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our
           substance.

15:008:022 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers
           and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because
           we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is
           upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his
           wrath is against all them that forsake him.

15:008:023 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was
           intreated of us.

15:008:024 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests,
           Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,

15:008:025 And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the
           vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the
           king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there
           present, had offered:

15:008:026 I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents
           of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold
           an hundred talents;

15:008:027 Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two
           vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.

15:008:028 And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels
           are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill
           offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.

15:008:029 Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief
           of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of
           Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the
           LORD.

15:008:030 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver,
           and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto
           the house of our God.

15:008:031 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
           the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God
           was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy,
           and of such as lay in wait by the way.

15:008:032 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.

15:008:033 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the
           vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of
           Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar
           the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of
           Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;

15:008:034 By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was
           written at that time.

15:008:035 Also the children of those that had been carried away, which
           were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto
           the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and
           six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin
           offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.

15:008:036 And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's
           lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and
           they furthered the people, and the house of God.

15:009:001 Now when these things were done, the princes came to me,
           saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the
           Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the
           lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the
           Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the
           Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.

15:009:002 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for
           their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with
           the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and
           rulers hath been chief in this trespass.

15:009:003 And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle,
           and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat
           down astonied.

15:009:004 Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the
           words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of
           those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the
           evening sacrifice.

15:009:005 And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and
           having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees,
           and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,

15:009:006 And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face
           to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our
           head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.

15:009:007 Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass
           unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and
           our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the
           lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to
           confusion of face, as it is this day.

15:009:008 And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the
           LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us
           a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes,
           and give us a little reviving in our bondage.

15:009:009 For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our
           bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the
           kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of
           our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us
           a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

15:009:010 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
           forsaken thy commandments,

15:009:011 Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets,
           saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an
           unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands,
           with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to
           another with their uncleanness.

15:009:012 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither
           take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or
           their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good
           of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
           for ever.

15:009:013 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for
           our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us
           less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such
           deliverance as this;

15:009:014 Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity
           with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be
           angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there
           should be no remnant nor escaping?

15:009:015 O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet
           escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our
           trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.

15:010:001 Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping
           and casting himself down before the house of God, there
           assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of
           men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.

15:010:002 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,
           answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our
           God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land:
           yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.

15:010:003 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away
           all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the
           counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the
           commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the
           law.

15:010:004 Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be
           with thee: be of good courage, and do it.

15:010:005 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and
           all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this
           word. And they sware.

15:010:006 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into
           the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came
           thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned
           because of the transgression of them that had been carried
           away.

15:010:007 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto
           all the children of the captivity, that they should gather
           themselves together unto Jerusalem;

15:010:008 And that whosoever would not come within three days, according
           to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his
           substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the
           congregation of those that had been carried away.

15:010:009 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
           together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth
           month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people
           sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of
           this matter, and for the great rain.

15:010:010 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
           transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the
           trespass of Israel.

15:010:011 Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your
           fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the
           people of the land, and from the strange wives.

15:010:012 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
           As thou hast said, so must we do.

15:010:013 But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we
           are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one
           day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this
           thing.

15:010:014 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all
           them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at
           appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and
           the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this
           matter be turned from us.

15:010:015 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
           were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai
           the Levite helped them.

15:010:016 And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,
           with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their
           fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and
           sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the
           matter.

15:010:017 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange
           wives by the first day of the first month.

15:010:018 And among the sons of the priests there were found that had
           taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of
           Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib,
           and Gedaliah.

15:010:019 And they gave their hands that they would put away their
           wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for
           their trespass.

15:010:020 And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.

15:010:021 And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah,
           and Jehiel, and Uzziah.

15:010:022 And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael,
           Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

15:010:023 Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the
           same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.

15:010:024 Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum,
           and Telem, and Uri.

15:010:025 Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah,
           and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and
           Benaiah.

15:010:026 And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and
           Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.

15:010:027 And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and
           Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.

15:010:028 Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and
           Athlai.

15:010:029 And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah,
           Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.

15:010:030 And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah,
           Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.

15:010:031 And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah,
           Shemaiah, Shimeon,

15:010:032 Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.

15:010:033 Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet,
           Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.

15:010:034 Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,

15:010:035 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,

15:010:036 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

15:010:037 Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,

15:010:038 And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,

15:010:039 And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,

15:010:040 Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,

15:010:041 Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,

15:010:042 Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.

15:010:043 Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau,
           and Joel, Benaiah.

15:010:044 All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives
           by whom they had children.

Book 16        Nehemiah

16:001:001 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to
           pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in
           Shushan the palace,

16:001:002 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of
           Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,
           which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

16:001:003 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the
           captivity there in the province are in great affliction and
           reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the
           gates thereof are burned with fire.

16:001:004 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down
           and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed
           before the God of heaven,

16:001:005 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and
           terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
           love him and observe his commandments:

16:001:006 Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou
           mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before
           thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy
           servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel,
           which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's
           house have sinned.

16:001:007 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept
           the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which
           thou commandedst thy servant Moses.

16:001:008 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
           servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you
           abroad among the nations:

16:001:009 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them;
           though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of
           the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring
           them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.

16:001:010 Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
           redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.

16:001:011 O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the
           prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who
           desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant
           this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I
           was the king's cupbearer.

16:002:001 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year
           of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took
           up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been
           beforetime sad in his presence.

16:002:002 Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,
           seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of
           heart. Then I was very sore afraid,

16:002:003 And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should
           not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my
           fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are
           consumed with fire?

16:002:004 Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?
           So I prayed to the God of heaven.

16:002:005 And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
           servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest
           send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres,
           that I may build it.

16:002:006 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,)
           For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return?
           So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.

16:002:007 Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let
           letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that
           they may convey me over till I come into Judah;

16:002:008 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that
           he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the
           palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the
           city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king
           granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

16:002:009 Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them
           the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army
           and horsemen with me.

16:002:010 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
           Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there
           was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

16:002:011 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.

16:002:012 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither
           told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at
           Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast
           that I rode upon.

16:002:013 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
           the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of
           Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were
           consumed with fire.

16:002:014 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's
           pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me
           to pass.

16:002:015 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
           and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so
           returned.

16:002:016 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither
           had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to
           the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the
           work.

16:002:017 Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
           Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with
           fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we
           be no more a reproach.

16:002:018 Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me;
           as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they
           said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their
           hands for this good work.

16:002:019 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
           Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to
           scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye
           do? will ye rebel against the king?

16:002:020 Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven,
           he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and
           build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in
           Jerusalem.

16:003:001 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the
           priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it,
           and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they
           sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.

16:003:002 And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them
           builded Zaccur the son of Imri.

16:003:003 But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also
           laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the
           locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

16:003:004 And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the
           son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of
           Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired
           Zadok the son of Baana.

16:003:005 And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put
           not their necks to the work of their LORD.

16:003:006 Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and
           Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof,
           and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the
           bars thereof.

16:003:007 And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon
           the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the
           throne of the governor on this side the river.

16:003:008 Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the
           goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of
           one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the
           broad wall.

16:003:009 And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler
           of the half part of Jerusalem.

16:003:010 And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even
           over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the
           son of Hashabniah.

16:003:011 Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab,
           repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.

16:003:012 And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the
           ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.

16:003:013 The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah;
           they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks
           thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the
           wall unto the dung gate.

16:003:014 But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the
           ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the
           doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

16:003:015 But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of
           Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and
           covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof,
           and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by
           the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the
           city of David.

16:003:016 After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the
           half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the
           sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto
           the house of the mighty.

16:003:017 After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next
           unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of
           Keilah, in his part.

16:003:018 After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad,
           the ruler of the half part of Keilah.

16:003:019 And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of
           Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury
           at the turning of the wall.

16:003:020 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the
           other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the
           house of Eliashib the high priest.

16:003:021 After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz
           another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to
           the end of the house of Eliashib.

16:003:022 And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.

16:003:023 After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their
           house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son
           of Ananiah by his house.

16:003:024 After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece,
           from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even
           unto the corner.

16:003:025 Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall,
           and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that
           was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of
           Parosh.

16:003:026 Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over
           against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that
           lieth out.

16:003:027 After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against
           the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.

16:003:028 From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over
           against his house.

16:003:029 After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his
           house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah,
           the keeper of the east gate.

16:003:030 After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun
           the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired
           Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.

16:003:031 After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place
           of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate
           Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.

16:003:032 And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate
           repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.

16:004:001 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded
           the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked
           the Jews.

16:004:002 And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and
           said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves?
           will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they
           revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are
           burned?

16:004:003 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that
           which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down
           their stone wall.

16:004:004 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach
           upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of
           captivity:

16:004:005 And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted
           out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger
           before the builders.

16:004:006 So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together
           unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.

16:004:007 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
           Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that
           the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches
           began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,

16:004:008 And conspired all of them together to come and to fight
           against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.

16:004:009 Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
           against them day and night, because of them.

16:004:010 And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
           decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to
           build the wall.

16:004:011 And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
           till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause
           the work to cease.

16:004:012 And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
           came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye
           shall return unto us they will be upon you.

16:004:013 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on
           the higher places, I even set the people after their families
           with their swords, their spears, and their bows.

16:004:014 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to
           the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of
           them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and
           fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your
           wives, and your houses.

16:004:015 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
           unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we
           returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.

16:004:016 And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
           servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held
           both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the
           habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.

16:004:017 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens,
           with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought
           in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.

16:004:018 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side,
           and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.

16:004:019 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest
           of the people, The work is great and large, and we are
           separated upon the wall, one far from another.

16:004:020 In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
           resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.

16:004:021 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears
           from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.

16:004:022 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every
           one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night
           they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.

16:004:023 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of
           the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes,
           saving that every one put them off for washing.

16:005:001 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives
           against their brethren the Jews.

16:005:002 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
           many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and
           live.

16:005:003 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
           vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the
           dearth.

16:005:004 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the
           king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.

16:005:005 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our
           children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our
           sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our
           daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in
           our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and
           vineyards.

16:005:006 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.

16:005:007 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and
           the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of
           his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.

16:005:008 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
           brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will
           ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us?
           Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.

16:005:009 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk
           in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen
           our enemies?

16:005:010 I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of
           them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

16:005:011 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands,
           their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the
           hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and
           the oil, that ye exact of them.

16:005:012 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing
           of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the
           priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do
           according to this promise.

16:005:013 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from
           his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this
           promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the
           congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people
           did according to this promise.

16:005:014 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their
           governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even
           unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that
           is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread
           of the governor.

16:005:015 But the former governors that had been before me were
           chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and
           wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants
           bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the
           fear of God.

16:005:016 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought
           we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto
           the work.

16:005:017 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the
           Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the
           heathen that are about us.

16:005:018 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
           choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten
           days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not
           I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy
           upon this people.

16:005:019 Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have
           done for this people.

16:006:001 Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
           Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded
           the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though
           at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)

16:006:002 That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us
           meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono.
           But they thought to do me mischief.

16:006:003 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great
           work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease,
           whilst I leave it, and come down to you?

16:006:004 Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I
           answered them after the same manner.

16:006:005 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the
           fifth time with an open letter in his hand;

16:006:006 Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and
           Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for
           which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their
           king, according to these words.

16:006:007 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
           Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it
           be reported to the king according to these words. Come now
           therefore, and let us take counsel together.

16:006:008 Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as
           thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.

16:006:009 For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be
           weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O
           God, strengthen my hands.

16:006:010 Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
           the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us
           meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let
           us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay
           thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.

16:006:011 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there,
           that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his
           life? I will not go in.

16:006:012 And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
           pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat
           had hired him.

16:006:013 Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so,
           and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report,
           that they might reproach me.

16:006:014 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to
           these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest
           of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.

16:006:015 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the
           month Elul, in fifty and two days.

16:006:016 And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof,
           and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they
           were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that
           this work was wrought of our God.

16:006:017 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters
           unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.

16:006:018 For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was
           the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son
           Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of
           Berechiah.

16:006:019 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my
           words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

16:007:001 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up
           the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites
           were appointed,

16:007:002 That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
           palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and
           feared God above many.

16:007:003 And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
           until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut
           the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the
           inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every
           one to be over against his house.

16:007:004 Now the city was large and great: but the people were few
           therein, and the houses were not builded.

16:007:005 And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles,
           and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by
           genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them
           which came up at the first, and found written therein,

16:007:006 These are the children of the province, that went up out of
           the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom
           Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came
           again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;

16:007:007 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah,
           Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.

16:007:060 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
           were three hundred ninety and two.

16:007:061 And these were they which went up also from Telmelah,
           Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew
           their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of
           Israel.

16:007:062 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children
           of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.

16:007:063 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of
           Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the
           daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called
           after their name.

16:007:064 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
           genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as
           polluted, put from the priesthood.

16:007:065 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
           the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
           and Thummim.

16:007:066 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
           three hundred and threescore,

16:007:067 Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there
           were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they
           had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.

16:007:068 Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two
           hundred forty and five:

16:007:069 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven
           hundred and twenty asses.

16:007:070 And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The
           Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty
           basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.

16:007:071 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of
           the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and
           two hundred pound of silver.

16:007:072 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand
           drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and
           threescore and seven priests' garments.

16:007:073 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the
           singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all
           Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month
           came, the children of Israel were in their cities.

16:008:001 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man
           into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake
           unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses,
           which the LORD had commanded to Israel.

16:008:002 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation
           both of men and women, and all that could hear with
           understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.

16:008:003 And he read therein before the street that was before the
           water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and
           the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of
           all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.

16:008:004 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they
           had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and
           Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on
           his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael,
           and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and
           Meshullam.

16:008:005 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for
           he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the
           people stood up:

16:008:006 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people
           answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they
           bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to
           the ground.

16:008:007 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub,
           Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad,
           Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to
           understand the law: and the people stood in their place.

16:008:008 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and
           gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.

16:008:009 And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
           scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all
           the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn
           not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the
           words of the law.

16:008:010 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink
           the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is
           prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye
           sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.

16:008:011 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your
           peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.

16:008:012 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to
           send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had
           understood the words that were declared unto them.

16:008:013 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the
           fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto
           Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.

16:008:014 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded
           by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths
           in the feast of the seventh month:

16:008:015 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities,
           and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch
           olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and
           palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as
           it is written.

16:008:016 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made
           themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and
           in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in
           the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of
           Ephraim.

16:008:017 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of
           the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since
           the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the
           children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.

16:008:018 Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read
           in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven
           days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according
           unto the manner.

16:009:001 Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of
           Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and
           earth upon them.

16:009:002 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all
           strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the
           iniquities of their fathers.

16:009:003 And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the
           law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and
           another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD
           their God.

16:009:004 Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and
           Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani,
           and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.

16:009:005 Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,
           Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up
           and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be
           thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and
           praise.

16:009:006 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the
           heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all
           things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein,
           and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven
           worshippeth thee.

16:009:007 Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and
           broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him
           the name of Abraham;

16:009:008 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a
           covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the
           Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites,
           and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast
           performed thy words; for thou art righteous:

16:009:009 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and
           heardest their cry by the Red sea;

16:009:010 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his
           servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest
           that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a
           name, as it is this day.

16:009:011 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went
           through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their
           persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the
           mighty waters.

16:009:012 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and
           in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the
           way wherein they should go.

16:009:013 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them
           from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws,
           good statutes and commandments:

16:009:014 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst
           them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy
           servant:

16:009:015 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and
           broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their
           thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess
           the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.

16:009:016 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their
           necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,

16:009:017 And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that
           thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their
           rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but
           thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to
           anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.

16:009:018 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is
           thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought
           great provocations;

16:009:019 Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the
           wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by
           day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by
           night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.

16:009:020 Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and
           withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them
           water for their thirst.

16:009:021 Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so
           that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and
           their feet swelled not.

16:009:022 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst
           divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon,
           and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king
           of Bashan.

16:009:023 Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven,
           and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst
           promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess
           it.

16:009:024 So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou
           subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the
           Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their
           kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with
           them as they would.

16:009:025 And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed
           houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and
           oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and
           were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy
           great goodness.

16:009:026 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee,
           and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets
           which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they
           wrought great provocations.

16:009:027 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their
           enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble,
           when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and
           according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours,
           who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.

16:009:028 But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee:
           therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so
           that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned,
           and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many
           times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;

16:009:029 And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them
           again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not
           unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments,
           (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the
           shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.

16:009:030 Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst
           against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not
           give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the
           people of the lands.

16:009:031 Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not
           utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a
           gracious and merciful God.

16:009:032 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the
           terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the
           trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on
           our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our
           prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the
           time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.

16:009:033 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou
           hast done right, but we have done wickedly:

16:009:034 Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our
           fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and
           thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.

16:009:035 For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy
           great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat
           land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from
           their wicked works.

16:009:036 Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou
           gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good
           thereof, behold, we are servants in it:

16:009:037 And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast
           set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over
           our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are
           in great distress.

16:009:038 And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it;
           and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.

16:010:001 Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son
           of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,

16:010:002 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

16:010:003 Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,

16:010:028 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the
           porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had
           separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law
           of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every
           one having knowledge, and having understanding;

16:010:029 They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a
           curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given
           by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the
           commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his
           statutes;

16:010:030 And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of
           the land, not take their daughters for our sons:

16:010:031 And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on
           the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on
           the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the
           seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.

16:010:032 Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly
           with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house
           of our God;

16:010:033 For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and
           for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new
           moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for
           the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all
           the work of the house of our God.

16:010:034 And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the
           people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of
           our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed
           year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as
           it is written in the law:

16:010:035 And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the
           firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the
           house of the LORD:

16:010:036 Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is
           written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our
           flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests
           that minister in the house of our God:

16:010:037 And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our
           offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and
           of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our
           God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the
           same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our
           tillage.

16:010:038 And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites,
           when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up
           the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the
           chambers, into the treasure house.

16:010:039 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall
           bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil,
           unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and
           the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers:
           and we will not forsake the house of our God.

16:011:001 And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of
           the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in
           Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other
           cities.

16:011:002 And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered
           themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.

16:011:003 Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in
           Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his
           possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and
           the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's
           servants.

16:011:004 And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and
           of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah
           the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah,
           the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children
           of Perez;

           of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of
           Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.

16:011:006 All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four
           hundred threescore and eight valiant men.

16:011:007 And these are the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of
           Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of
           Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of
           Jesaiah.

16:011:008 And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.

16:011:009 And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the
           son of Senuah was second over the city.

16:011:010 Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.

16:011:011 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of
           Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler
           of the house of God.

16:011:012 And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight
           hundred twenty and two: and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son
           of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of
           Pashur, the son of Malchiah.

16:011:013 And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and
           two: and Amashai the son of Azareel, the son of Ahasai, the
           son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,

16:011:014 And their brethren, mighty men of valour, an hundred twenty
           and eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of one of
           the great men.

16:011:015 Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of
           Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;

16:011:016 And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had
           the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.

16:011:017 And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of
           Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer:
           and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son
           of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.

16:011:018 All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore
           and four.

16:011:019 Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that
           kept the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.

16:011:020 And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites,
           were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.

16:011:021 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over
           the Nethinims.

16:011:022 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son
           of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son
           of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the
           business of the house of God.

16:011:023 For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a
           certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.

16:011:024 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah
           the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters
           concerning the people.

16:011:025 And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children
           of Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and in the villages thereof,
           and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel,
           and in the villages thereof,

16:011:026 And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Bethphelet,

16:011:027 And at Hazarshual, and at Beersheba, and in the villages
           thereof,

16:011:028 And at Ziklag, and at Mekonah, and in the villages thereof,

16:011:029 And at Enrimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth,

16:011:030 Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish, and the
           fields thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And
           they dwelt from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom.

16:011:031 The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and
           Aija, and Bethel, and in their villages.

16:011:032 And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

16:011:033 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

16:011:034 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

16:011:035 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.

16:011:036 And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.

16:012:001 Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with
           Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah,
           Jeremiah, Ezra,

16:012:002 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

16:012:003 Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

16:012:004 Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,

16:012:005 Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

16:012:006 Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

16:012:007 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chief of the
           priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.

16:012:008 Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah,
           Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and
           his brethren.

16:012:009 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against
           them in the watches.

16:012:010 And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and
           Eliashib begat Joiada,

16:012:011 And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.

16:012:012 And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the
           fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

16:012:013 Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

16:012:014 Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

16:012:015 Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;

16:012:016 Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

16:012:017 Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai:

16:012:018 Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

16:012:019 And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

16:012:020 Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

16:012:021 Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.

16:012:022 The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
           Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests,
           to the reign of Darius the Persian.

16:012:023 The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in
           the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the
           son of Eliashib.

16:012:024 And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua
           the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to
           praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of
           David the man of God, ward over against ward.

16:012:025 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
           were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.

16:012:026 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son
           of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of
           Ezra the priest, the scribe.

16:012:027 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
           Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem,
           to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings,
           and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.

16:012:028 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both
           out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the
           villages of Netophathi;

16:012:029 Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba
           and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round
           about Jerusalem.

16:012:030 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and
           purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.

16:012:031 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and
           appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks,
           whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the
           dung gate:

16:012:032 And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of
           Judah,

16:012:033 And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

16:012:034 Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,

16:012:035 And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely,
           Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of
           Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of
           Asaph:

16:012:036 And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai,
           Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical
           instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe
           before them.

16:012:037 And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they
           went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of
           the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate
           eastward.

16:012:038 And the other company of them that gave thanks went over
           against them, and I after them, and the half of the people
           upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto
           the broad wall;

16:012:039 And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate,
           and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the
           tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still
           in the prison gate.

16:012:040 So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the
           house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:

16:012:041 And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah,
           Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;

16:012:042 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and
           Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers
           sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.

16:012:043 Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for
           God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and
           the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard
           even afar off.

16:012:044 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
           treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the
           tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities
           the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah
           rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.

16:012:045 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their
           God, and the ward of the purification, according to the
           commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.

16:012:046 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of
           the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.

16:012:047 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
           Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters,
           every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto
           the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children
           of Aaron.

16:013:001 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of
           the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite
           and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God
           for ever;

16:013:002 Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and
           with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should
           curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.

16:013:003 Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
           separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.

16:013:004 And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of
           the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:

16:013:005 And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime
           they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the
           vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the
           oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the
           singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.

16:013:006 But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two
           and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto
           the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:

16:013:007 And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that
           Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the
           courts of the house of God.

16:013:008 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the
           household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.

16:013:009 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither
           brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat
           offering and the frankincense.

16:013:010 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
           given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the
           work, were fled every one to his field.

16:013:011 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house
           of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in
           their place.

16:013:012 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine
           and the oil unto the treasuries.

16:013:013 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the
           priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and
           next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of
           Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office
           was to distribute unto their brethren.

16:013:014 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my
           good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for
           the offices thereof.

16:013:015 In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
           sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also
           wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they
           brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified
           against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.

16:013:016 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and
           all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children
           of Judah, and in Jerusalem.

16:013:017 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,
           What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath
           day?

16:013:018 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this
           evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon
           Israel by profaning the sabbath.

16:013:019 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
           be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should
           be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after
           the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that
           there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.

16:013:020 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged
           without Jerusalem once or twice.

16:013:021 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge
           ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you.
           From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.

16:013:022 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse
           themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to
           sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning
           this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy
           mercy.

16:013:023 In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of
           Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:

16:013:024 And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and
           could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the
           language of each people.

16:013:025 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain
           of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by
           God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons,
           nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.

16:013:026 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among
           many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of
           his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless
           even him did outlandish women cause to sin.

16:013:027 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to
           transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?

16:013:028 And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high
           priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I
           chased him from me.

16:013:029 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the
           priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the
           Levites.

16:013:030 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the
           wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his
           business;

16:013:031 And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the
           firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

Book 17        Esther

17:001:001 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is
           Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over
           an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)

17:001:002 That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne
           of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,

17:001:003 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his
           princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the
           nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:

17:001:004 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the
           honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and
           fourscore days.

17:001:005 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto
           all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both
           unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden
           of the king's palace;

17:001:006 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with
           cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of
           marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of
           red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.

17:001:007 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels
           being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance,
           according to the state of the king.

17:001:008 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel:
           for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his
           house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.

17:001:009 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
           house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.

17:001:010 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with
           wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and
           Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that
           served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,

17:001:011 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown
           royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she
           was fair to look on.

17:001:012 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment
           by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and
           his anger burned in him.

17:001:013 Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for
           so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and
           judgment:

17:001:014 And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha,
           Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of
           Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the
           first in the kingdom;)

17:001:015 What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law,
           because she hath not performed the commandment of the king
           Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?

17:001:016 And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti
           the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to
           all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the
           provinces of the king Ahasuerus.

17:001:017 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women,
           so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when
           it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the
           queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.

17:001:018 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day
           unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of
           the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.

17:001:019 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from
           him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and
           the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more
           before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate
           unto another that is better than she.

17:001:020 And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be
           published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all
           the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great
           and small.

17:001:021 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king
           did according to the word of Memucan:

17:001:022 For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every
           province according to the writing thereof, and to every people
           after their language, that every man should bear rule in his
           own house, and that it should be published according to the
           language of every people.

17:002:001 After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was
           appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and
           what was decreed against her.

17:002:002 Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let
           there be fair young virgins sought for the king:

17:002:003 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his
           kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young
           virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women,
           unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the
           women; and let their things for purification be given them:

17:002:004 And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of
           Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.

17:002:005 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name
           was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of
           Kish, a Benjamite;

17:002:006 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
           which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom
           Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.

17:002:007 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's
           daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid
           was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and
           mother were dead, took for his own daughter.

17:002:008 So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree
           was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto
           Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was
           brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai,
           keeper of the women.

17:002:009 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him;
           and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with
           such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were
           meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he
           preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house
           of the women.

17:002:010 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai
           had charged her that she should not shew it.

17:002:011 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's
           house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.

17:002:012 Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king
           Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to
           the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their
           purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of
           myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things
           for the purifying of the women;)

17:002:013 Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she
           desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the
           women unto the king's house.

17:002:014 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into
           the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz,
           the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in
           unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and
           that she were called by name.

17:002:015 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle
           of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to
           go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the
           king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And
           Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked
           upon her.

17:002:016 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal
           in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh
           year of his reign.

17:002:017 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she
           obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the
           virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and
           made her queen instead of Vashti.

17:002:018 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
           servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the
           provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.

17:002:019 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time,
           then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.

17:002:020 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as
           Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of
           Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.

17:002:021 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of
           the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which
           kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king
           Ahasuerus.

17:002:022 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther
           the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's
           name.

17:002:023 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
           therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written
           in the book of the chronicles before the king.

17:003:001 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
           Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat
           above all the princes that were with him.

17:003:002 And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate,
           bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded
           concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.

17:003:003 Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said
           unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?

17:003:004 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he
           hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether
           Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he
           was a Jew.

17:003:005 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him
           reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.

17:003:006 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they
           had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought
           to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom
           of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.

17:003:007 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth
           year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot,
           before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the
           twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.

17:003:008 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
           scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the
           provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all
           people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not
           for the king's profit to suffer them.

17:003:009 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
           destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to
           the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to
           bring it into the king's treasuries.

17:003:010 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto
           Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.

17:003:011 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the
           people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.

17:003:012 Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of
           the first month, and there was written according to all that
           Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the
           governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of
           every people of every province according to the writing
           thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name
           of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's
           ring.

17:003:013 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's
           provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all
           Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one
           day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which
           is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.

17:003:014 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
           province was published unto all people, that they should be
           ready against that day.

17:003:015 The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment,
           and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king
           and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was
           perplexed.

17:004:001 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
           clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into
           the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;

17:004:002 And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter
           into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.

17:004:003 And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment
           and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews,
           and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in
           sackcloth and ashes.

17:004:004 So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her.
           Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment
           to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him:
           but he received it not.

17:004:005 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains,
           whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a
           commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.

17:004:006 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
           which was before the king's gate.

17:004:007 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and
           of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the
           king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.

17:004:008 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that
           was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther,
           and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should
           go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to
           make request before him for her people.

17:004:009 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.

17:004:010 Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
           Mordecai;

17:004:011 All the king's servants, and the people of the king's
           provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women,
           shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not
           called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except
           such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that
           he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the
           king these thirty days.

17:004:012 And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.

17:004:013 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with
           thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than
           all the Jews.

17:004:014 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then
           shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from
           another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be
           destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the
           kingdom for such a time as this?

17:004:015 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,

17:004:016 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan,
           and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days,
           night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so
           will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law:
           and if I perish, I perish.

17:004:017 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
           had commanded him.

17:005:001 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her
           royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's
           house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon
           his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of
           the house.

17:005:002 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in
           the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king
           held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So
           Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.

17:005:003 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
           what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half
           of the kingdom.

17:005:004 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the
           king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have
           prepared for him.

17:005:005 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do
           as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet
           that Esther had prepared.

17:005:006 And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is
           thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy
           request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be
           performed.

17:005:007 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;

17:005:008 If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it
           please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my
           request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I
           shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king
           hath said.

17:005:009 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart:
           but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood
           not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against
           Mordecai.

17:005:010 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home,
           he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.

17:005:011 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the
           multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king
           had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the
           princes and servants of the king.

17:005:012 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come
           in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but
           myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the
           king.

17:005:013 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
           the Jew sitting at the king's gate.

17:005:014 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
           gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou
           unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go
           thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing
           pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

17:006:001 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to
           bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were
           read before the king.

17:006:002 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
           and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the
           door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

17:006:003 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
           Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that
           ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.

17:006:004 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come
           into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the
           king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for
           him.

17:006:005 And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth
           in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.

17:006:006 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be
           done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now
           Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to
           do honour more than to myself?

17:006:007 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king
           delighteth to honour,

17:006:008 Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear,
           and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal
           which is set upon his head:

17:006:009 And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one
           of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man
           withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on
           horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before
           him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth
           to honour.

17:006:010 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel
           and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai
           the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of
           all that thou hast spoken.

17:006:011 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed
           Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of
           the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done
           unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.

17:006:012 And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted
           to his house mourning, and having his head covered.

17:006:013 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing
           that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his
           wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before
           whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against
           him, but shalt surely fall before him.

17:006:014 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's
           chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that
           Esther had prepared.

17:007:001 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

17:007:002 And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the
           banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it
           shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall
           be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.

17:007:003 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found
           favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my
           life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:

17:007:004 For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be
           slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and
           bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not
           countervail the king's damage.

17:007:005 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the
           queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his
           heart to do so?

17:007:006 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
           Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.

17:007:007 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath
           went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make
           request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that
           there was evil determined against him by the king.

17:007:008 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place
           of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed
           whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the
           queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of
           king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.

17:007:009 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
           Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had
           made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in
           the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.

17:007:010 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
           Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.

17:008:001 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the
           Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before
           the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.

17:008:002 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman,
           and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the
           house of Haman.

17:008:003 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at
           his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief
           of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised
           against the Jews.

17:008:004 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So
           Esther arose, and stood before the king,

17:008:005 And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his
           sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be
           pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters
           devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he
           wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's
           provinces:

17:008:006 For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my
           people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my
           kindred?

17:008:007 Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to
           Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of
           Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he
           laid his hand upon the Jews.

17:008:008 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's
           name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which
           is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's
           ring, may no man reverse.

17:008:009 Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third
           month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth
           day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai
           commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the
           deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto
           Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every
           province according to the writing thereof, and unto every
           people after their language, and to the Jews according to
           their writing, and according to their language.

17:008:010 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with
           the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and
           riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:

17:008:011 Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to
           gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to
           destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the
           people and province that would assault them, both little ones
           and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,

17:008:012 Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely,
           upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the
           month Adar.

17:008:013 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
           province was published unto all people, and that the Jews
           should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their
           enemies.

17:008:014 So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being
           hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the
           decree was given at Shushan the palace.

17:008:015 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
           apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and
           with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of
           Shushan rejoiced and was glad.

17:008:016 The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.

17:008:017 And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the
           king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and
           gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of
           the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.

17:009:001 Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the
           thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and
           his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that
           the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though
           it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over
           them that hated them;)

17:009:002 The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities
           throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay
           hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand
           them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.

17:009:003 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and
           the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews;
           because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.

17:009:004 For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went
           out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed
           greater and greater.

17:009:005 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
           sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would
           unto those that hated them.

17:009:006 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five
           hundred men.

17:009:007 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

17:009:008 And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,

17:009:009 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,

17:009:010 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the
           Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.

17:009:011 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
           palace was brought before the king.

17:009:012 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain
           and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the
           ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the
           king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be
           granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be
           done.

17:009:013 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to
           the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according
           unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged
           upon the gallows.

17:009:014 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was
           given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.

17:009:015 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together
           on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three
           hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their
           hand.

17:009:016 But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered
           themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest
           from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five
           thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,

17:009:017 On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth
           day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and
           gladness.

17:009:018 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
           thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on
           the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day
           of feasting and gladness.

17:009:019 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
           towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of
           gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions
           one to another.

17:009:020 And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the
           Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
           both nigh and far,

17:009:021 To stablish this among them, that they should keep the
           fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the
           same, yearly,

17:009:022 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and
           the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and
           from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days
           of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another,
           and gifts to the poor.

17:009:023 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as
           Mordecai had written unto them;

17:009:024 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of
           all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them,
           and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to
           destroy them;

17:009:025 But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters
           that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews,
           should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons
           should be hanged on the gallows.

17:009:026 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
           Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which
           they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto
           them,

17:009:027 The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed,
           and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it
           should not fail, that they would keep these two days according
           to their writing, and according to their appointed time every
           year;

17:009:028 And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout
           every generation, every family, every province, and every
           city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among
           the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.

17:009:029 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
           the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second
           letter of Purim.

17:009:030 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred
           twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with
           words of peace and truth,

17:009:031 To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed,
           according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had
           enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for
           their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.

17:009:032 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and
           it was written in the book.

17:010:001 And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon
           the isles of the sea.

17:010:002 And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the
           declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king
           advanced him, are they not written in the book of the
           chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?

17:010:003 For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great
           among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren,
           seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all
           his seed.

Book 18        Job

18:001:001 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and
           that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and
           eschewed evil.

18:001:002 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.

18:001:003 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three
           thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five
           hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this
           man was the greatest of all the men of the east.

18:001:004 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his
           day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to
           drink with them.

18:001:005 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone
           about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in
           the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the
           number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have
           sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job
           continually.

18:001:006 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
           themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.

18:001:007 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
           answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the
           earth, and from walking up and down in it.

18:001:008 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
           Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
           an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?

18:001:009 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for
           nought?

18:001:010 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,
           and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed
           the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
           land.

18:001:011 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and
           he will curse thee to thy face.

18:001:012 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in
           thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So
           Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.

18:001:013 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were
           eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:

18:001:014 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
           plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:

18:001:015 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they
           have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only
           am escaped alone to tell thee.

18:001:016 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
           The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the
           sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am
           escaped alone to tell thee.

18:001:017 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
           The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,
           and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with
           the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell
           thee.

18:001:018 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
           Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in
           their eldest brother's house:

18:001:019 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and
           smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the
           young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to
           tell thee.

18:001:020 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
           fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,

18:001:021 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
           shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken
           away; blessed be the name of the LORD.

18:001:022 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

18:002:001 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
           themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to
           present himself before the LORD.

18:002:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And
           Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in
           the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

18:002:003 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
           Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
           an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and
           still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me
           against him, to destroy him without cause.

18:002:004 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
           that a man hath will he give for his life.

18:002:005 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his
           flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.

18:002:006 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
           save his life.

18:002:007 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote
           Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.

18:002:008 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he
           sat down among the ashes.

18:002:009 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
           integrity? curse God, and die.

18:002:010 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
           women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of
           God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job
           sin with his lips.

18:002:011 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was
           come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz
           the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
           Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come
           to mourn with him and to comfort him.

18:002:012 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,
           they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one
           his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.

18:002:013 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
           nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his
           grief was very great.

18:003:001 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

18:003:002 And Job spake, and said,

18:003:003 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which
           it was said, There is a man child conceived.

18:003:004 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
           neither let the light shine upon it.

18:003:005 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud
           dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

18:003:006 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
           joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the
           number of the months.

18:003:007 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come
           therein.

18:003:008 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise
           up their mourning.

18:003:009 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for
           light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the
           day:

18:003:010 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid
           sorrow from mine eyes.

18:003:011 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
           when I came out of the belly?

18:003:012 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should
           suck?

18:003:013 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have
           slept: then had I been at rest,

18:003:014 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate
           places for themselves;

18:003:015 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with
           silver:

18:003:016 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants
           which never saw light.

18:003:017 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be
           at rest.

18:003:018 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of
           the oppressor.

18:003:019 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from
           his master.

18:003:020 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life
           unto the bitter in soul;

18:003:021 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more
           than for hid treasures;

18:003:022 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find
           the grave?

18:003:023 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God
           hath hedged in?

18:003:024 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured
           out like the waters.

18:003:025 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that
           which I was afraid of is come unto me.

18:003:026 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet;
           yet trouble came.

18:004:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

18:004:002 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but
           who can withhold himself from speaking?

18:004:003 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened
           the weak hands.

18:004:004 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
           strengthened the feeble knees.

18:004:005 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth
           thee, and thou art troubled.

18:004:006 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
           uprightness of thy ways?

18:004:007 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or
           where were the righteous cut off?

18:004:008 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow
           wickedness, reap the same.

18:004:009 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his
           nostrils are they consumed.

18:004:010 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and
           the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

18:004:011 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's
           whelps are scattered abroad.

18:004:012 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received
           a little thereof.

18:004:013 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
           falleth on men,

18:004:014 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to
           shake.

18:004:015 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh
           stood up:

18:004:016 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an
           image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a
           voice, saying,

18:004:017 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more
           pure than his maker?

18:004:018 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he
           charged with folly:

18:004:019 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose
           foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?

18:004:020 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for
           ever without any regarding it.

18:004:021 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,
           even without wisdom.

18:005:001 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which
           of the saints wilt thou turn?

18:005:002 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly
           one.

18:005:003 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
           habitation.

18:005:004 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
           gate, neither is there any to deliver them.

18:005:005 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of
           the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.

18:005:006 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth
           trouble spring out of the ground;

18:005:007 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

18:005:008 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:

18:005:009 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things
           without number:

18:005:010 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the
           fields:

18:005:011 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn
           may be exalted to safety.

18:005:012 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their
           hands cannot perform their enterprise.

18:005:013 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of
           the froward is carried headlong.

18:005:014 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the
           noonday as in the night.

18:005:015 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and
           from the hand of the mighty.

18:005:016 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

18:005:017 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore
           despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:

18:005:018 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands
           make whole.

18:005:019 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there
           shall no evil touch thee.

18:005:020 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the
           power of the sword.

18:005:021 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither
           shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

18:005:022 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou
           be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

18:005:023 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and
           the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

18:005:024 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and
           thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.

18:005:025 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
           offspring as the grass of the earth.

18:005:026 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of
           corn cometh in in his season.

18:005:027 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou
           it for thy good.

18:006:001 But Job answered and said,

18:006:002 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid
           in the balances together!

18:006:003 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
           therefore my words are swallowed up.

18:006:004 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison
           whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set
           themselves in array against me.

18:006:005 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox
           over his fodder?

18:006:006 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there
           any taste in the white of an egg?

18:006:007 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful
           meat.

18:006:008 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me
           the thing that I long for!

18:006:009 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let
           loose his hand, and cut me off!

18:006:010 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in
           sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words
           of the Holy One.

18:006:011 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,
           that I should prolong my life?

18:006:012 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of
           brass?

18:006:013 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

18:006:014 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his
           friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

18:006:015 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the
           stream of brooks they pass away;

18:006:016 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow
           is hid:

18:006:017 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are
           consumed out of their place.

18:006:018 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing,
           and perish.

18:006:019 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for
           them.

18:006:020 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came
           thither, and were ashamed.

18:006:021 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are
           afraid.

18:006:022 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
           substance?

18:006:023 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the
           hand of the mighty?

18:006:024 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to
           understand wherein I have erred.

18:006:025 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing
           reprove?

18:006:026 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that
           is desperate, which are as wind?

18:006:027 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your
           friend.

18:006:028 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto
           you if I lie.

18:006:029 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again,
           my righteousness is in it.

18:006:030 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern
           perverse things?

18:007:001 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his
           days also like the days of an hireling?

18:007:002 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling
           looketh for the reward of his work:

18:007:003 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights
           are appointed to me.

18:007:004 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be
           gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of
           the day.

18:007:005 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
           broken, and become loathsome.

18:007:006 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent
           without hope.

18:007:007 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see
           good.

18:007:008 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine
           eyes are upon me, and I am not.

18:007:009 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth
           down to the grave shall come up no more.

18:007:010 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
           know him any more.

18:007:011 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the
           anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my
           soul.

18:007:012 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?

18:007:013 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my
           complaints;

18:007:014 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through
           visions:

18:007:015 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my
           life.

18:007:016 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days
           are vanity.

18:007:017 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou
           shouldest set thine heart upon him?

18:007:018 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him
           every moment?

18:007:019 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I
           swallow down my spittle?

18:007:020 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of
           men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am
           a burden to myself?

18:007:021 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away
           my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt
           seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.

18:008:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

18:008:002 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the
           words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?

18:008:003 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert
           justice?

18:008:004 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them
           away for their transgression;

18:008:005 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy
           supplication to the Almighty;

18:008:006 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for
           thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

18:008:007 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should
           greatly increase.

18:008:008 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare
           thyself to the search of their fathers:

18:008:009 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our
           days upon earth are a shadow:)

18:008:010 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out
           of their heart?

18:008:011 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without
           water?

18:008:012 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it
           withereth before any other herb.

18:008:013 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's
           hope shall perish:

18:008:014 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a
           spider's web.

18:008:015 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall
           hold it fast, but it shall not endure.

18:008:016 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in
           his garden.

18:008:017 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of
           stones.

18:008:018 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him,
           saying, I have not seen thee.

18:008:019 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall
           others grow.

18:008:020 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he
           help the evil doers:

18:008:021 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with
           rejoicing.

18:008:022 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the
           dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.

18:009:001 Then Job answered and said,

18:009:002 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with
           God?

18:009:003 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a
           thousand.

18:009:004 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened
           himself against him, and hath prospered?

18:009:005 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which
           overturneth them in his anger.

18:009:006 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars
           thereof tremble.

18:009:007 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up
           the stars.

18:009:008 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the
           waves of the sea.

18:009:009 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers
           of the south.

18:009:010 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders
           without number.

18:009:011 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but
           I perceive him not.

18:009:012 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto
           him, What doest thou?

18:009:013 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop
           under him.

18:009:014 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to
           reason with him?

18:009:015 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I
           would make supplication to my judge.

18:009:016 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not
           believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.

18:009:017 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds
           without cause.

18:009:018 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
           bitterness.

18:009:019 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment,
           who shall set me a time to plead?

18:009:020 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I
           say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

18:009:021 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would
           despise my life.

18:009:022 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the
           perfect and the wicked.

18:009:023 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of
           the innocent.

18:009:024 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth
           the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?

18:009:025 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see
           no good.

18:009:026 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that
           hasteth to the prey.

18:009:027 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my
           heaviness, and comfort myself:

18:009:028 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold
           me innocent.

18:009:029 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?

18:009:030 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so
           clean;

18:009:031 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes
           shall abhor me.

18:009:032 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we
           should come together in judgment.

18:009:033 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his
           hand upon us both.

18:009:034 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear
           terrify me:

18:009:035 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with
           me.

18:010:001 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
           myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

18:010:002 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
           contendest with me.

18:010:003 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou
           shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the
           counsel of the wicked?

18:010:004 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?

18:010:005 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,

18:010:006 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after
           my sin?

18:010:007 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can
           deliver out of thine hand.

18:010:008 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round
           about; yet thou dost destroy me.

18:010:009 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;
           and wilt thou bring me into dust again?

18:010:010 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like
           cheese?

18:010:011 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me
           with bones and sinews.

18:010:012 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
           preserved my spirit.

18:010:013 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that
           this is with thee.

18:010:014 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me
           from mine iniquity.

18:010:015 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I
           not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see
           thou mine affliction;

18:010:016 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again
           thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

18:010:017 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
           indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.

18:010:018 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh
           that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!

18:010:019 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have
           been carried from the womb to the grave.

18:010:020 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may
           take comfort a little,

18:010:021 Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of
           darkness and the shadow of death;

18:010:022 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of
           death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.

18:011:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

18:011:002 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a
           man full of talk be justified?

18:011:003 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou
           mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?

18:011:004 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in
           thine eyes.

18:011:005 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;

18:011:006 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they
           are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth
           of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.

18:011:007 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
           Almighty unto perfection?

18:011:008 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell;
           what canst thou know?

18:011:009 The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than
           the sea.

18:011:010 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can
           hinder him?

18:011:011 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not
           then consider it?

18:011:012 For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild
           ass's colt.

18:011:013 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands
           toward him;

18:011:014 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not
           wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

18:011:015 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou
           shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:

18:011:016 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as
           waters that pass away:

18:011:017 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt
           shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.

18:011:018 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou
           shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

18:011:019 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
           yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

18:011:020 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not
           escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.

18:012:001 And Job answered and said,

18:012:002 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

18:012:003 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to
           you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

18:012:004 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and
           he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.

18:012:005 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised
           in the thought of him that is at ease.

18:012:006 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God
           are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.

18:012:007 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the
           fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:

18:012:008 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes
           of the sea shall declare unto thee.

18:012:009 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath
           wrought this?

18:012:010 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the
           breath of all mankind.

18:012:011 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

18:012:012 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days
           understanding.

18:012:013 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
           understanding.

18:012:014 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he
           shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

18:012:015 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he
           sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

18:012:016 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver
           are his.

18:012:017 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges
           fools.

18:012:018 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a
           girdle.

18:012:019 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

18:012:020 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
           understanding of the aged.

18:012:021 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength
           of the mighty.

18:012:022 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out
           to light the shadow of death.

18:012:023 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth
           the nations, and straiteneth them again.

18:012:024 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
           earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there
           is no way.

18:012:025 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to
           stagger like a drunken man.

18:013:001 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and
           understood it.

18:013:002 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto
           you.

18:013:003 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason
           with God.

18:013:004 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.

18:013:005 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be
           your wisdom.

18:013:006 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my
           lips.

18:013:007 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

18:013:008 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?

18:013:009 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man
           mocketh another, do ye so mock him?

18:013:010 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.

18:013:011 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall
           upon you?

18:013:012 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies
           of clay.

18:013:013 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come
           on me what will.

18:013:014 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in
           mine hand?

18:013:015 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will
           maintain mine own ways before him.

18:013:016 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
           before him.

18:013:017 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

18:013:018 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be
           justified.

18:013:019 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my
           tongue, I shall give up the ghost.

18:013:020 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself
           from thee.

18:013:021 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
           afraid.

18:013:022 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer
           thou me.

18:013:023 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
           transgression and my sin.

18:013:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine
           enemy?

18:013:025 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue
           the dry stubble?

18:013:026 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to
           possess the iniquities of my youth.

18:013:027 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly
           unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my
           feet.

18:013:028 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is
           moth eaten.

18:014:001 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of
           trouble.

18:014:002 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also
           as a shadow, and continueth not.

18:014:003 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest
           me into judgment with thee?

18:014:004 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.

18:014:005 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are
           with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;

18:014:006 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as
           an hireling, his day.

18:014:007 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
           sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not
           cease.

18:014:008 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
           thereof die in the ground;

18:014:009 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
           boughs like a plant.

18:014:010 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
           and where is he?

18:014:011 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and
           drieth up:

18:014:012 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no
           more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

18:014:013 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest
           keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest
           appoint me a set time, and remember me!

18:014:014 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my
           appointed time will I wait, till my change come.

18:014:015 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a
           desire to the work of thine hands.

18:014:016 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my
           sin?

18:014:017 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up
           mine iniquity.

18:014:018 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the
           rock is removed out of his place.

18:014:019 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which
           grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the
           hope of man.

18:014:020 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou
           changest his countenance, and sendest him away.

18:014:021 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are
           brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.

18:014:022 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within
           him shall mourn.

18:015:001 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,

18:015:002 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly
           with the east wind?

18:015:003 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches
           wherewith he can do no good?

18:015:004 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.

18:015:005 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the
           tongue of the crafty.

18:015:006 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own
           lips testify against thee.

18:015:007 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before
           the hills?

18:015:008 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain
           wisdom to thyself?

18:015:009 What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou,
           which is not in us?

18:015:010 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder
           than thy father.

18:015:011 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any
           secret thing with thee?

18:015:012 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes
           wink at,

18:015:013 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such
           words go out of thy mouth?

18:015:014 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of
           a woman, that he should be righteous?

18:015:015 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens
           are not clean in his sight.

18:015:016 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh
           iniquity like water?

18:015:017 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will
           declare;

18:015:018 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid
           it:

18:015:019 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed
           among them.

18:015:020 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the
           number of years is hidden to the oppressor.

18:015:021 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer
           shall come upon him.

18:015:022 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he
           is waited for of the sword.

18:015:023 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth
           that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

18:015:024 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
           against him, as a king ready to the battle.

18:015:025 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth
           himself against the Almighty.

18:015:026 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses
           of his bucklers:

18:015:027 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh
           collops of fat on his flanks.

18:015:028 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man
           inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.

18:015:029 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
           neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the
           earth.

18:015:030 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up
           his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.

18:015:031 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall
           be his recompence.

18:015:032 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall
           not be green.

18:015:033 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall
           cast off his flower as the olive.

18:015:034 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire
           shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.

18:015:035 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their
           belly prepareth deceit.

18:016:001 Then Job answered and said,

18:016:002 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye
           all.

18:016:003 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that
           thou answerest?

18:016:004 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's
           stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head
           at you.

18:016:005 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my
           lips should asswage your grief.

18:016:006 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I
           forbear, what am I eased?

18:016:007 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my
           company.

18:016:008 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness
           against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to
           my face.

18:016:009 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
           with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

18:016:010 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me
           upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves
           together against me.

18:016:011 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into
           the hands of the wicked.

18:016:012 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also
           taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up
           for his mark.

18:016:013 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
           asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the
           ground.

18:016:014 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me
           like a giant.

18:016:015 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in
           the dust.

18:016:016 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow
           of death;

18:016:017 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.

18:016:018 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no
           place.

18:016:019 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on
           high.

18:016:020 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.

18:016:021 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth
           for his neighbour!

18:016:022 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I
           shall not return.

18:017:001 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are
           ready for me.

18:017:002 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue
           in their provocation?

18:017:003 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that
           will strike hands with me?

18:017:004 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore
           shalt thou not exalt them.

18:017:005 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his
           children shall fail.

18:017:006 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I
           was as a tabret.

18:017:007 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members
           are as a shadow.

18:017:008 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall
           stir up himself against the hypocrite.

18:017:009 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath
           clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.

18:017:010 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot
           find one wise man among you.

18:017:011 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the
           thoughts of my heart.

18:017:012 They change the night into day: the light is short because of
           darkness.

18:017:013 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the
           darkness.

18:017:014 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm,
           Thou art my mother, and my sister.

18:017:015 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?

18:017:016 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest
           together is in the dust.

18:018:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

18:018:002 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and
           afterwards we will speak.

18:018:003 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your
           sight?

18:018:004 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken
           for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

18:018:005 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark
           of his fire shall not shine.

18:018:006 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle
           shall be put out with him.

18:018:007 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own
           counsel shall cast him down.

18:018:008 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon
           a snare.

18:018:009 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall
           prevail against him.

18:018:010 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in
           the way.

18:018:011 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive
           him to his feet.

18:018:012 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be
           ready at his side.

18:018:013 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn
           of death shall devour his strength.

18:018:014 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it
           shall bring him to the king of terrors.

18:018:015 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
           brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

18:018:016 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his
           branch be cut off.

18:018:017 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have
           no name in the street.

18:018:018 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of
           the world.

18:018:019 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any
           remaining in his dwellings.

18:018:020 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they
           that went before were affrighted.

18:018:021 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the
           place of him that knoweth not God.

18:019:001 Then Job answered and said,

18:019:002 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with
           words?

18:019:003 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that
           ye make yourselves strange to me.

18:019:004 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with
           myself.

18:019:005 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
           against me my reproach:

18:019:006 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me
           with his net.

18:019:007 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud,
           but there is no judgment.

18:019:008 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
           darkness in my paths.

18:019:009 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my
           head.

18:019:010 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine
           hope hath he removed like a tree.

18:019:011 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me
           unto him as one of his enemies.

18:019:012 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me,
           and encamp round about my tabernacle.

18:019:013 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are
           verily estranged from me.

18:019:014 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have
           forgotten me.

18:019:015 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a
           stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

18:019:016 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him
           with my mouth.

18:019:017 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the
           children's sake of mine own body.

18:019:018 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake
           against me.

18:019:019 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are
           turned against me.

18:019:020 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped
           with the skin of my teeth.

18:019:021 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the
           hand of God hath touched me.

18:019:022 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my
           flesh?

18:019:023 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed
           in a book!

18:019:024 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock
           for ever!

18:019:025 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at
           the latter day upon the earth:

18:019:026 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
           flesh shall I see God:

18:019:027 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and
           not another; though my reins be consumed within me.

18:019:028 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of
           the matter is found in me?

18:019:029 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments
           of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.

18:020:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

18:020:002 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I
           make haste.

18:020:003 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
           understanding causeth me to answer.

18:020:004 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,

18:020:005 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
           hypocrite but for a moment?

18:020:006 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head
           reach unto the clouds;

18:020:007 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which
           have seen him shall say, Where is he?

18:020:008 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he
           shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

18:020:009 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither
           shall his place any more behold him.

18:020:010 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands
           shall restore their goods.

18:020:011 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie
           down with him in the dust.

18:020:012 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it
           under his tongue;

18:020:013 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still
           within his mouth:

18:020:014 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps
           within him.

18:020:015 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up
           again: God shall cast them out of his belly.

18:020:016 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall
           slay him.

18:020:017 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey
           and butter.

18:020:018 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not
           swallow it down: according to his substance shall the
           restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.

18:020:019 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because
           he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;

18:020:020 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not
           save of that which he desired.

18:020:021 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man
           look for his goods.

18:020:022 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:
           every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.

18:020:023 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of
           his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is
           eating.

18:020:024 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall
           strike him through.

18:020:025 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering
           sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.

18:020:026 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not
           blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left
           in his tabernacle.

18:020:027 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise
           up against him.

18:020:028 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall
           flow away in the day of his wrath.

18:020:029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
           appointed unto him by God.

18:021:001 But Job answered and said,

18:021:002 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.

18:021:003 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock
           on.

18:021:004 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why
           should not my spirit be troubled?

18:021:005 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.

18:021:006 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on
           my flesh.

18:021:007 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in
           power?

18:021:008 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their
           offspring before their eyes.

18:021:009 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God
           upon them.

18:021:010 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and
           casteth not her calf.

18:021:011 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their
           children dance.

18:021:012 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of
           the organ.

18:021:013 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to
           the grave.

18:021:014 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not
           the knowledge of thy ways.

18:021:015 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what
           profit should we have, if we pray unto him?

18:021:016 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked
           is far from me.

18:021:017 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft
           cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows
           in his anger.

18:021:018 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the
           storm carrieth away.

18:021:019 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,
           and he shall know it.

18:021:020 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the
           wrath of the Almighty.

18:021:021 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the
           number of his months is cut off in the midst?

18:021:022 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that
           are high.

18:021:023 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and
           quiet.

18:021:024 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with
           marrow.

18:021:025 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never
           eateth with pleasure.

18:021:026 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall
           cover them.

18:021:027 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye
           wrongfully imagine against me.

18:021:028 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are
           the dwelling places of the wicked?

18:021:029 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know
           their tokens,

18:021:030 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they
           shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.

18:021:031 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him
           what he hath done?

18:021:032 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the
           tomb.

18:021:033 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man
           shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.

18:021:034 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there
           remaineth falsehood?

18:022:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

18:022:002 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
           profitable unto himself?

18:022:003 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?
           or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?

18:022:004 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee
           into judgment?

18:022:005 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?

18:022:006 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and
           stripped the naked of their clothing.

18:022:007 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast
           withholden bread from the hungry.

18:022:008 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the
           honourable man dwelt in it.

18:022:009 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the
           fatherless have been broken.

18:022:010 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear
           troubleth thee;

18:022:011 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters
           cover thee.

18:022:012 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of
           the stars, how high they are!

18:022:013 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the
           dark cloud?

18:022:014 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he
           walketh in the circuit of heaven.

18:022:015 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?

18:022:016 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was
           overflown with a flood:

18:022:017 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty
           do for them?

18:022:018 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel
           of the wicked is far from me.

18:022:019 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh
           them to scorn.

18:022:020 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them
           the fire consumeth.

18:022:021 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good
           shall come unto thee.

18:022:022 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his
           words in thine heart.

18:022:023 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou
           shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.

18:022:024 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as
           the stones of the brooks.

18:022:025 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have
           plenty of silver.

18:022:026 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and
           shalt lift up thy face unto God.

18:022:027 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,
           and thou shalt pay thy vows.

18:022:028 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established
           unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.

18:022:029 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting
           up; and he shall save the humble person.

18:022:030 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is
           delivered by the pureness of thine hands.

18:023:001 Then Job answered and said,

18:023:002 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than
           my groaning.

18:023:003 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even
           to his seat!

18:023:004 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with
           arguments.

18:023:005 I would know the words which he would answer me, and
           understand what he would say unto me.

18:023:006 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he
           would put strength in me.

18:023:007 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
           delivered for ever from my judge.

18:023:008 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I
           cannot perceive him:

18:023:009 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:
           he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:

18:023:010 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I
           shall come forth as gold.

18:023:011 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not
           declined.

18:023:012 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I
           have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary
           food.

18:023:013 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul
           desireth, even that he doeth.

18:023:014 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many
           such things are with him.

18:023:015 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am
           afraid of him.

18:023:016 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:

18:023:017 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he
           covered the darkness from my face.

18:024:001 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they
           that know him not see his days?

18:024:002 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks,
           and feed thereof.

18:024:003 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the
           widow's ox for a pledge.

18:024:004 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
           themselves together.

18:024:005 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their
           work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food
           for them and for their children.

18:024:006 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the
           vintage of the wicked.

18:024:007 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have
           no covering in the cold.

18:024:008 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace
           the rock for want of a shelter.

18:024:009 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge
           of the poor.

18:024:010 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take
           away the sheaf from the hungry;

18:024:011 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their
           winepresses, and suffer thirst.

18:024:012 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
           crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.

18:024:013 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not
           the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

18:024:014 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
           and in the night is as a thief.

18:024:015 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
           saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.

18:024:016 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for
           themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.

18:024:017 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one
           know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.

18:024:018 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the
           earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

18:024:019 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave
           those which have sinned.

18:024:020 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;
           he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken
           as a tree.

18:024:021 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not
           good to the widow.

18:024:022 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and
           no man is sure of life.

18:024:023 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth;
           yet his eyes are upon their ways.

18:024:024 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought
           low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off
           as the tops of the ears of corn.

18:024:025 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my
           speech nothing worth?

18:025:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

18:025:002 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high
           places.

18:025:003 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his
           light arise?

18:025:004 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean
           that is born of a woman?

18:025:005 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars
           are not pure in his sight.

18:025:006 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which
           is a worm?

18:026:001 But Job answered and said,

18:026:002 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest
           thou the arm that hath no strength?

18:026:003 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast
           thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?

18:026:004 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from
           thee?

18:026:005 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the
           inhabitants thereof.

18:026:006 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

18:026:007 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth
           the earth upon nothing.

18:026:008 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is
           not rent under them.

18:026:009 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his
           cloud upon it.

18:026:010 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and
           night come to an end.

18:026:011 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his
           reproof.

18:026:012 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding
           he smiteth through the proud.

18:026:013 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath
           formed the crooked serpent.

18:026:014 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
           heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

18:027:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

18:027:002 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the
           Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;

18:027:003 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in
           my nostrils;

18:027:004 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter
           deceit.

18:027:005 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not
           remove mine integrity from me.

18:027:006 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart
           shall not reproach me so long as I live.

18:027:007 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against
           me as the unrighteous.

18:027:008 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
           when God taketh away his soul?

18:027:009 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?

18:027:010 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call
           upon God?

18:027:011 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the
           Almighty will I not conceal.

18:027:012 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
           altogether vain?

18:027:013 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage
           of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.

18:027:014 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his
           offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

18:027:015 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his
           widows shall not weep.

18:027:016 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as
           the clay;

18:027:017 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the
           innocent shall divide the silver.

18:027:018 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the
           keeper maketh.

18:027:019 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he
           openeth his eyes, and he is not.

18:027:020 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him
           away in the night.

18:027:021 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a
           storm hurleth him out of his place.

18:027:022 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee
           out of his hand.

18:027:023 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of
           his place.

18:028:001 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold
           where they fine it.

18:028:002 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the
           stone.

18:028:003 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all
           perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.

18:028:004 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters
           forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away
           from men.

18:028:005 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is
           turned up as it were fire.

18:028:006 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust
           of gold.

18:028:007 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's
           eye hath not seen:

18:028:008 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion
           passed by it.

18:028:009 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the
           mountains by the roots.

18:028:010 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every
           precious thing.

18:028:011 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is
           hid bringeth he forth to light.

18:028:012 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of
           understanding?

18:028:013 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the
           land of the living.

18:028:014 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not
           with me.

18:028:015 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
           for the price thereof.

18:028:016 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious
           onyx, or the sapphire.

18:028:017 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of
           it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.

18:028:018 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price
           of wisdom is above rubies.

18:028:019 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be
           valued with pure gold.

18:028:020 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
           understanding?

18:028:021 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close
           from the fowls of the air.

18:028:022 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with
           our ears.

18:028:023 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place
           thereof.

18:028:024 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the
           whole heaven;

18:028:025 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters
           by measure.

18:028:026 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the
           lightning of the thunder:

18:028:027 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and
           searched it out.

18:028:028 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is
           wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.

18:029:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

18:029:002 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God
           preserved me;

18:029:003 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I
           walked through darkness;

18:029:004 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was
           upon my tabernacle;

18:029:005 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about
           me;

18:029:006 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out
           rivers of oil;

18:029:007 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared
           my seat in the street!

18:029:008 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,
           and stood up.

18:029:009 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their
           mouth.

18:029:010 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the
           roof of their mouth.

18:029:011 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye
           saw me, it gave witness to me:

18:029:012 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless,
           and him that had none to help him.

18:029:013 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and
           I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

18:029:014 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as
           a robe and a diadem.

18:029:015 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.

18:029:016 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I
           searched out.

18:029:017 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out
           of his teeth.

18:029:018 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my
           days as the sand.

18:029:019 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all
           night upon my branch.

18:029:020 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

18:029:021 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
           counsel.

18:029:022 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped
           upon them.

18:029:023 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their
           mouth wide as for the latter rain.

18:029:024 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of
           my countenance they cast not down.

18:029:025 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in
           the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.

18:030:001 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
           whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs
           of my flock.

18:030:002 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in
           whom old age was perished?

18:030:003 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the
           wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

18:030:004 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their
           meat.

18:030:005 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them
           as after a thief;)

18:030:006 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth,
           and in the rocks.

18:030:007 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were
           gathered together.

18:030:008 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they
           were viler than the earth.

18:030:009 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.

18:030:010 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in
           my face.

18:030:011 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have
           also let loose the bridle before me.

18:030:012 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and
           they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.

18:030:013 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no
           helper.

18:030:014 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the
           desolation they rolled themselves upon me.

18:030:015 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind:
           and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.

18:030:016 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction
           have taken hold upon me.

18:030:017 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews
           take no rest.

18:030:018 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it
           bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.

18:030:019 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
           ashes.

18:030:020 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and
           thou regardest me not.

18:030:021 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou
           opposest thyself against me.

18:030:022 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon
           it, and dissolvest my substance.

18:030:023 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house
           appointed for all living.

18:030:024 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though
           they cry in his destruction.

18:030:025 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul
           grieved for the poor?

18:030:026 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I
           waited for light, there came darkness.

18:030:027 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction
           prevented me.

18:030:028 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in
           the congregation.

18:030:029 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

18:030:030 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

18:030:031 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the
           voice of them that weep.

18:031:001 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon
           a maid?

18:031:002 For what portion of God is there from above? and what
           inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

18:031:003 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to
           the workers of iniquity?

18:031:004 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

18:031:005 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to
           deceit;

18:031:006 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine
           integrity.

18:031:007 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked
           after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;

18:031:008 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be
           rooted out.

18:031:009 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid
           wait at my neighbour's door;

18:031:010 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down
           upon her.

18:031:011 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be
           punished by the judges.

18:031:012 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root
           out all mine increase.

18:031:013 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
           maidservant, when they contended with me;

18:031:014 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth,
           what shall I answer him?

18:031:015 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
           fashion us in the womb?

18:031:016 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused
           the eyes of the widow to fail;

18:031:017 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath
           not eaten thereof;

18:031:018 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a
           father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)

18:031:019 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor
           without covering;

18:031:020 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed
           with the fleece of my sheep;

18:031:021 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw
           my help in the gate:

18:031:022 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be
           broken from the bone.

18:031:023 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of
           his highness I could not endure.

18:031:024 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,
           Thou art my confidence;

18:031:025 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine
           hand had gotten much;

18:031:026 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in
           brightness;

18:031:027 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath
           kissed my hand:

18:031:028 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I
           should have denied the God that is above.

18:031:029 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or
           lifted up myself when evil found him:

18:031:030 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to
           his soul.

18:031:031 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his
           flesh! we cannot be satisfied.

18:031:032 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my
           doors to the traveller.

18:031:033 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine
           iniquity in my bosom:

18:031:034 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families
           terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?

18:031:035 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the
           Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written
           a book.

18:031:036 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a
           crown to me.

18:031:037 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince
           would I go near unto him.

18:031:038 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise
           thereof complain;

18:031:039 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have
           caused the owners thereof to lose their life:

18:031:040 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of
           barley. The words of Job are ended.

18:032:001 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was
           righteous in his own eyes.

18:032:002 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
           Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath
           kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.

18:032:003 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because
           they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

18:032:004 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were
           elder than he.

18:032:005 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
           three men, then his wrath was kindled.

18:032:006 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I
           am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and
           durst not shew you mine opinion.

18:032:007 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach
           wisdom.

18:032:008 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the
           Almighty giveth them understanding.

18:032:009 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand
           judgment.

18:032:010 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine
           opinion.

18:032:011 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,
           whilst ye searched out what to say.

18:032:012 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you
           that convinced Job, or that answered his words:

18:032:013 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth
           him down, not man.

18:032:014 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I
           answer him with your speeches.

18:032:015 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off
           speaking.

18:032:016 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and
           answered no more;)

18:032:017 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine
           opinion.

18:032:018 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

18:032:019 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to
           burst like new bottles.

18:032:020 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and
           answer.

18:032:021 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let
           me give flattering titles unto man.

18:032:022 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker
           would soon take me away.

18:033:001 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to
           all my words.

18:033:002 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in
           my mouth.

18:033:003 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips
           shall utter knowledge clearly.

18:033:004 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
           hath given me life.

18:033:005 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me,
           stand up.

18:033:006 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am
           formed out of the clay.

18:033:007 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my
           hand be heavy upon thee.

18:033:008 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the
           voice of thy words, saying,

18:033:009 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is
           there iniquity in me.

18:033:010 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for
           his enemy,

18:033:011 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.

18:033:012 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that
           God is greater than man.

18:033:013 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of
           any of his matters.

18:033:014 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.

18:033:015 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth
           upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;

18:033:016 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their
           instruction,

18:033:017 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from
           man.

18:033:018 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from
           perishing by the sword.

18:033:019 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude
           of his bones with strong pain:

18:033:020 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.

18:033:021 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his
           bones that were not seen stick out.

18:033:022 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
           destroyers.

18:033:023 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
           thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:

18:033:024 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from
           going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.

18:033:025 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to
           the days of his youth:

18:033:026 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him:
           and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto
           man his righteousness.

18:033:027 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and
           perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;

18:033:028 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life
           shall see the light.

18:033:029 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,

18:033:030 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with
           the light of the living.

18:033:031 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will
           speak.

18:033:032 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire
           to justify thee.

18:033:033 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach
           thee wisdom.

18:034:001 Furthermore Elihu answered and said,

18:034:002 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that
           have knowledge.

18:034:003 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.

18:034:004 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what
           is good.

18:034:005 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my
           judgment.

18:034:006 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without
           transgression.

18:034:007 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?

18:034:008 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and
           walketh with wicked men.

18:034:009 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should
           delight himself with God.

18:034:010 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it
           from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty,
           that he should commit iniquity.

18:034:011 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause
           every man to find according to his ways.

18:034:012 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the
           Almighty pervert judgment.

18:034:013 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath
           disposed the whole world?

18:034:014 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his
           spirit and his breath;

18:034:015 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto
           dust.

18:034:016 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the
           voice of my words.

18:034:017 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn
           him that is most just?

18:034:018 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes,
           Ye are ungodly?

18:034:019 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of
           princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they
           all are the work of his hands.

18:034:020 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled
           at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away
           without hand.

18:034:021 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
           goings.

18:034:022 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers
           of iniquity may hide themselves.

18:034:023 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should
           enter into judgment with God.

18:034:024 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set
           others in their stead.

18:034:025 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in
           the night, so that they are destroyed.

18:034:026 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;

18:034:027 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any
           of his ways:

18:034:028 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and
           he heareth the cry of the afflicted.

18:034:029 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when
           he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be
           done against a nation, or against a man only:

18:034:030 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.

18:034:031 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne
           chastisement, I will not offend any more:

18:034:032 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I
           will do no more.

18:034:033 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,
           whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I:
           therefore speak what thou knowest.

18:034:034 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken
           unto me.

18:034:035 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without
           wisdom.

18:034:036 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
           answers for wicked men.

18:034:037 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands
           among us, and multiplieth his words against God.

18:035:001 Elihu spake moreover, and said,

18:035:002 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My
           righteousness is more than God's?

18:035:003 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and,
           What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?

18:035:004 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.

18:035:005 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which
           are higher than thou.

18:035:006 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy
           transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?

18:035:007 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth
           he of thine hand?

18:035:008 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy
           righteousness may profit the son of man.

18:035:009 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the
           oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the
           mighty.

18:035:010 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the
           night;

18:035:011 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh
           us wiser than the fowls of heaven?

18:035:012 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride
           of evil men.

18:035:013 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty
           regard it.

18:035:014 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is
           before him; therefore trust thou in him.

18:035:015 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;
           yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:

18:035:016 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth
           words without knowledge.

18:036:001 Elihu also proceeded, and said,

18:036:002 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to
           speak on God's behalf.

18:036:003 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe
           righteousness to my Maker.

18:036:004 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in
           knowledge is with thee.

18:036:005 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in
           strength and wisdom.

18:036:006 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to
           the poor.

18:036:007 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings
           are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever,
           and they are exalted.

18:036:008 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of
           affliction;

18:036:009 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that
           they have exceeded.

18:036:010 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that
           they return from iniquity.

18:036:011 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in
           prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

18:036:012 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they
           shall die without knowledge.

18:036:013 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when
           he bindeth them.

18:036:014 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.

18:036:015 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their
           ears in oppression.

18:036:016 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
           broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which
           should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.

18:036:017 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment
           and justice take hold on thee.

18:036:018 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
           stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

18:036:019 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
           strength.

18:036:020 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

18:036:021 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen
           rather than affliction.

18:036:022 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?

18:036:023 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast
           wrought iniquity?

18:036:024 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.

18:036:025 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.

18:036:026 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the
           number of his years be searched out.

18:036:027 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain
           according to the vapour thereof:

18:036:028 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.

18:036:029 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the
           noise of his tabernacle?

18:036:030 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the
           bottom of the sea.

18:036:031 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in
           abundance.

18:036:032 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to
           shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.

18:036:033 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also
           concerning the vapour.

18:037:001 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his
           place.

18:037:002 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that
           goeth out of his mouth.

18:037:003 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto
           the ends of the earth.

18:037:004 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
           excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.

18:037:005 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth
           he, which we cannot comprehend.

18:037:006 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to
           the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.

18:037:007 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his
           work.

18:037:008 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.

18:037:009 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the
           north.

18:037:010 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the
           waters is straitened.

18:037:011 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth
           his bright cloud:

18:037:012 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do
           whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in
           the earth.

18:037:013 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his
           land, or for mercy.

18:037:014 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the
           wondrous works of God.

18:037:015 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of
           his cloud to shine?

18:037:016 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous
           works of him which is perfect in knowledge?

18:037:017 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
           south wind?

18:037:018 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as
           a molten looking glass?

18:037:019 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our
           speech by reason of darkness.

18:037:020 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he
           shall be swallowed up.

18:037:021 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds:
           but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.

18:037:022 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible
           majesty.

18:037:023 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent
           in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will
           not afflict.

18:037:024 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise
           of heart.

18:038:001 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

18:038:002 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

18:038:003 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee,
           and answer thou me.

18:038:004 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
           declare, if thou hast understanding.

18:038:005 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who
           hath stretched the line upon it?

18:038:006 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid
           the corner stone thereof;

18:038:007 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
           shouted for joy?

18:038:008 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if
           it had issued out of the womb?

18:038:009 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness
           a swaddlingband for it,

18:038:010 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,

18:038:011 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here
           shall thy proud waves be stayed?

18:038:012 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the
           dayspring to know his place;

18:038:013 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the
           wicked might be shaken out of it?

18:038:014 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.

18:038:015 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high
           arm shall be broken.

18:038:016 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou
           walked in the search of the depth?

18:038:017 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou
           seen the doors of the shadow of death?

18:038:018 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou
           knowest it all.

18:038:019 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,
           where is the place thereof,

18:038:020 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that
           thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?

18:038:021 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the
           number of thy days is great?

18:038:022 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou
           seen the treasures of the hail,

18:038:023 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the
           day of battle and war?

18:038:024 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east
           wind upon the earth?

18:038:025 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
           or a way for the lightning of thunder;

18:038:026 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the
           wilderness, wherein there is no man;

18:038:027 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud
           of the tender herb to spring forth?

18:038:028 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

18:038:029 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven,
           who hath gendered it?

18:038:030 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep
           is frozen.

18:038:031 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
           bands of Orion?

18:038:032 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou
           guide Arcturus with his sons?

18:038:033 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the
           dominion thereof in the earth?

18:038:034 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of
           waters may cover thee?

18:038:035 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto
           thee, Here we are?

18:038:036 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given
           understanding to the heart?

18:038:037 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the
           bottles of heaven,

18:038:038 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast
           together?

18:038:039 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of
           the young lions,

18:038:040 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie
           in wait?

18:038:041 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry
           unto God, they wander for lack of meat.

18:039:001 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring
           forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

18:039:002 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou
           the time when they bring forth?

18:039:003 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they
           cast out their sorrows.

18:039:004 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;
           they go forth, and return not unto them.

18:039:005 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the
           bands of the wild ass?

18:039:006 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land
           his dwellings.

18:039:007 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he
           the crying of the driver.

18:039:008 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth
           after every green thing.

18:039:009 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy
           crib?

18:039:010 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or
           will he harrow the valleys after thee?

18:039:011 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt
           thou leave thy labour to him?

18:039:012 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and
           gather it into thy barn?

18:039:013 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and
           feathers unto the ostrich?

18:039:014 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,

18:039:015 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild
           beast may break them.

18:039:016 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were
           not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;

18:039:017 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he
           imparted to her understanding.

18:039:018 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the
           horse and his rider.

18:039:019 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck
           with thunder?

18:039:020 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his
           nostrils is terrible.

18:039:021 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he
           goeth on to meet the armed men.

18:039:022 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he
           back from the sword.

18:039:023 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
           shield.

18:039:024 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither
           believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.

18:039:025 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the
           battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the
           shouting.

18:039:026 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
           the south?

18:039:027 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on
           high?

18:039:028 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the
           rock, and the strong place.

18:039:029 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar
           off.

18:039:030 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are,
           there is she.

18:040:001 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,

18:040:002 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he
           that reproveth God, let him answer it.

18:040:003 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

18:040:004 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine
           hand upon my mouth.

18:040:005 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I
           will proceed no further.

18:040:006 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and
           said,

18:040:007 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and
           declare thou unto me.

18:040:008 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me,
           that thou mayest be righteous?

18:040:009 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice
           like him?

18:040:010 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array
           thyself with glory and beauty.

18:040:011 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that
           is proud, and abase him.

18:040:012 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread
           down the wicked in their place.

18:040:013 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in
           secret.

18:040:014 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand
           can save thee.

18:040:015 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass
           as an ox.

18:040:016 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the
           navel of his belly.

18:040:017 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are
           wrapped together.

18:040:018 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like
           bars of iron.

18:040:019 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make
           his sword to approach unto him.

18:040:020 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the
           beasts of the field play.

18:040:021 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and
           fens.

18:040:022 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of
           the brook compass him about.

18:040:023 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth
           that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

18:040:024 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.

18:041:001 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with
           a cord which thou lettest down?

18:041:002 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through
           with a thorn?

18:041:003 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft
           words unto thee?

18:041:004 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a
           servant for ever?

18:041:005 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him
           for thy maidens?

18:041:006 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part
           him among the merchants?

18:041:007 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with
           fish spears?

18:041:008 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

18:041:009 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down
           even at the sight of him?

18:041:010 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to
           stand before me?

18:041:011 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is
           under the whole heaven is mine.

18:041:012 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
           proportion.

18:041:013 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to
           him with his double bridle?

18:041:014 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible
           round about.

18:041:015 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close
           seal.

18:041:016 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

18:041:017 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they
           cannot be sundered.

18:041:018 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the
           eyelids of the morning.

18:041:019 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap
           out.

18:041:020 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or
           caldron.

18:041:021 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

18:041:022 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy
           before him.

18:041:023 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in
           themselves; they cannot be moved.

18:041:024 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of
           the nether millstone.

18:041:025 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason
           of breakings they purify themselves.

18:041:026 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear,
           the dart, nor the habergeon.

18:041:027 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

18:041:028 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with
           him into stubble.

18:041:029 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a
           spear.

18:041:030 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things
           upon the mire.

18:041:031 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like
           a pot of ointment.

18:041:032 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep
           to be hoary.

18:041:033 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

18:041:034 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the
           children of pride.

18:042:001 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

18:042:002 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can
           be withholden from thee.

18:042:003 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore
           have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for
           me, which I knew not.

18:042:004 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,
           and declare thou unto me.

18:042:005 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine
           eye seeth thee.

18:042:006 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.

18:042:007 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
           Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is
           kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have
           not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job
           hath.

18:042:008 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and
           go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt
           offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will
           I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye
           have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my
           servant Job.

18:042:009 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
           Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them:
           the LORD also accepted Job.

18:042:010 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for
           his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had
           before.

18:042:011 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his
           sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance
           before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they
           bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the
           LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of
           money, and every one an earring of gold.

18:042:012 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his
           beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six
           thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand
           she asses.

18:042:013 He had also seven sons and three daughters.

18:042:014 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of
           the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.

18:042:015 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the
           daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among
           their brethren.

18:042:016 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his
           sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.

18:042:017 So Job died, being old and full of days.

Book 19        Psalms

19:001:001 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
           ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in
           the seat of the scornful.

19:001:002 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth
           he meditate day and night.

19:001:003 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
           that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also
           shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

19:001:004 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
           driveth away.

19:001:005 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor
           sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

19:001:006 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of
           the ungodly shall perish.

19:002:001 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

19:002:002 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
           counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed,
           saying,

19:002:003 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords
           from us.

19:002:004 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall
           have them in derision.

19:002:005 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in
           his sore displeasure.

19:002:006 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

19:002:007 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou
           art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

19:002:008 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
           inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
           possession.

19:002:009 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them
           in pieces like a potter's vessel.

19:002:010 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of
           the earth.

19:002:011 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

19:002:012 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
           when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they
           that put their trust in him.

19:003:001 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they
           that rise up against me.

19:003:002 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him
           in God. Selah.

19:003:003 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the
           lifter up of mine head.

19:003:004 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of
           his holy hill. Selah.

19:003:005 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

19:003:006 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
           themselves against me round about.

19:003:007 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all
           mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth
           of the ungodly.

19:003:008 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy
           people. Selah.

19:004:001 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast
           enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and
           hear my prayer.

19:004:002 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
           how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.

19:004:003 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for
           himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

19:004:004 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon
           your bed, and be still. Selah.

19:004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in
           the LORD.

19:004:006 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift
           thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.

19:004:007 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
           their corn and their wine increased.

19:004:008 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD,
           only makest me dwell in safety.

19:005:001 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

19:005:002 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for
           unto thee will I pray.

19:005:003 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the
           morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

19:005:004 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
           neither shall evil dwell with thee.

19:005:005 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all
           workers of iniquity.

19:005:006 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will
           abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

19:005:007 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of
           thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy
           temple.

19:005:008 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
           make thy way straight before my face.

19:005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part
           is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they
           flatter with their tongue.

19:005:010 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
           cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for
           they have rebelled against thee.

19:005:011 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let
           them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them
           also that love thy name be joyful in thee.

19:005:012 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt
           thou compass him as with a shield.

19:006:001 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in
           thy hot displeasure.

19:006:002 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me;
           for my bones are vexed.

19:006:003 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

19:006:004 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'
           sake.

19:006:005 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
           shall give thee thanks?

19:006:006 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to
           swim; I water my couch with my tears.

19:006:007 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because
           of all mine enemies.

19:006:008 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath
           heard the voice of my weeping.

19:006:009 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my
           prayer.

19:006:010 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them
           return and be ashamed suddenly.

19:007:001 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all
           them that persecute me, and deliver me:

19:007:002 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while
           there is none to deliver.

19:007:003 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my
           hands;

19:007:004 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
           (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

19:007:005 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him
           tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the
           dust. Selah.

19:007:006 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the
           rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that
           thou hast commanded.

19:007:007 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
           for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

19:007:008 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according
           to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is
           in me.

19:007:009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but
           establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts
           and reins.

19:007:010 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

19:007:011 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked
           every day.

19:007:012 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow,
           and made it ready.

19:007:013 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he
           ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

19:007:014 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived
           mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

19:007:015 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch
           which he made.

19:007:016 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent
           dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

19:007:017 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and
           will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

19:008:001 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
           who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

19:008:002 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
           strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still
           the enemy and the avenger.

19:008:003 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon
           and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

19:008:004 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,
           that thou visitest him?

19:008:005 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and
           hast crowned him with glory and honour.

19:008:006 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
           thou hast put all things under his feet:

19:008:007 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

19:008:008 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
           passeth through the paths of the seas.

19:008:009 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

19:009:001 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew
           forth all thy marvellous works.

19:009:002 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy
           name, O thou most High.

19:009:003 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish
           at thy presence.

19:009:004 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in
           the throne judging right.

19:009:005 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
           thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

19:009:006 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and
           thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with
           them.

19:009:007 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his
           throne for judgment.

19:009:008 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall
           minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

19:009:009 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
           times of trouble.

19:009:010 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for
           thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

19:009:011 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare
           among the people his doings.

19:009:012 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
           forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

19:009:013 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer
           of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates
           of death:

19:009:014 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the
           daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

19:009:015 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the
           net which they hid is their own foot taken.

19:009:016 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the
           wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion.
           Selah.

19:009:017 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that
           forget God.

19:009:018 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of
           the poor shall not perish for ever.

19:009:019 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged
           in thy sight.

19:009:020 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves
           to be but men. Selah.

19:010:001 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in
           times of trouble?

19:010:002 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
           taken in the devices that they have imagined.

19:010:003 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth
           the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.

19:010:004 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not
           seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.

19:010:005 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out
           of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

19:010:006 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall
           never be in adversity.

19:010:007 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
           tongue is mischief and vanity.

19:010:008 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the
           secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are
           privily set against the poor.

19:010:009 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in
           wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he
           draweth him into his net.

19:010:010 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by
           his strong ones.

19:010:011 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
           face; he will never see it.

19:010:012 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the
           humble.

19:010:013 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
           heart, Thou wilt not require it.

19:010:014 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
           requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto
           thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.

19:010:015 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out
           his wickedness till thou find none.

19:010:016 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished
           out of his land.

19:010:017 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt
           prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

19:010:018 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
           earth may no more oppress.

19:011:001 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a
           bird to your mountain?

19:011:002 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their
           arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the
           upright in heart.

19:011:003 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

19:011:004 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in
           heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

19:011:005 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that
           loveth violence his soul hateth.

19:011:006 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and
           an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.

19:011:007 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance
           doth behold the upright.

19:012:001 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail
           from among the children of men.

19:012:002 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with
           flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.

19:012:003 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue
           that speaketh proud things:

19:012:004 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are
           our own: who is lord over us?

19:012:005 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,
           now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety
           from him that puffeth at him.

19:012:006 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a
           furnace of earth, purified seven times.

19:012:007 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from
           this generation for ever.

19:012:008 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are
           exalted.

19:013:001 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt
           thou hide thy face from me?

19:013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
           heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

19:013:003 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I
           sleep the sleep of death;

19:013:004 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those
           that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

19:013:005 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
           salvation.

19:013:006 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully
           with me.

19:014:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
           corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that
           doeth good.

19:014:002 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to
           see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

19:014:003 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:
           there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

19:014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
           people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

19:014:005 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of
           the righteous.

19:014:006 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is
           his refuge.

19:014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when
           the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob
           shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

19:015:001 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in
           thy holy hill?

19:015:002 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
           speaketh the truth in his heart.

19:015:003 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
           neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

19:015:004 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth
           them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and
           changeth not.

19:015:005 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
           against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never
           be moved.

19:016:001 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

19:016:002 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
           goodness extendeth not to thee;

19:016:003 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent,
           in whom is all my delight.

19:016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another
           god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take
           up their names into my lips.

19:016:005 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
           thou maintainest my lot.

19:016:006 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a
           goodly heritage.

19:016:007 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins
           also instruct me in the night seasons.

19:016:008 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my
           right hand, I shall not be moved.

19:016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh
           also shall rest in hope.

19:016:010 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
           suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

19:016:011 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness
           of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

19:017:001 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
           prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.

19:017:002 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes
           behold the things that are equal.

19:017:003 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the
           night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am
           purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

19:017:004 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have
           kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

19:017:005 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

19:017:006 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline
           thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.

19:017:007 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
           right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that
           rise up against them.

19:017:008 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of
           thy wings,

19:017:009 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
           compass me about.

19:017:010 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they
           speak proudly.

19:017:011 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their
           eyes bowing down to the earth;

19:017:012 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
           young lion lurking in secret places.

19:017:013 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul
           from the wicked, which is thy sword:

19:017:014 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
           which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou
           fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and
           leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

19:017:015 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
           satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

19:018:001 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

19:018:002 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my
           God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the
           horn of my salvation, and my high tower.

19:018:003 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so
           shall I be saved from mine enemies.

19:018:004 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly
           men made me afraid.

19:018:005 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death
           prevented me.

19:018:006 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God:
           he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before
           him, even into his ears.

19:018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
           hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

19:018:008 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
           mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

19:018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was
           under his feet.

19:018:010 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon
           the wings of the wind.

19:018:011 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about
           him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

19:018:012 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
           hail stones and coals of fire.

19:018:013 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave
           his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

19:018:014 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot
           out lightnings, and discomfited them.

19:018:015 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of
           the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast
           of the breath of thy nostrils.

19:018:016 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

19:018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which
           hated me: for they were too strong for me.

19:018:018 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
           my stay.

19:018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
           because he delighted in me.

19:018:020 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according
           to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

19:018:021 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
           departed from my God.

19:018:022 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away
           his statutes from me.

19:018:023 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
           iniquity.

19:018:024 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
           righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his
           eyesight.

19:018:025 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
           upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

19:018:026 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
           froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.

19:018:027 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
           high looks.

19:018:028 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten
           my darkness.

19:018:029 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
           leaped over a wall.

19:018:030 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
           he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.

19:018:031 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?

19:018:032 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
           perfect.

19:018:033 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my
           high places.

19:018:034 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken
           by mine arms.

19:018:035 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
           right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me
           great.

19:018:036 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not
           slip.

19:018:037 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I
           turn again till they were consumed.

19:018:038 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
           fallen under my feet.

19:018:039 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou
           hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

19:018:040 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I
           might destroy them that hate me.

19:018:041 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the
           LORD, but he answered them not.

19:018:042 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did
           cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

19:018:043 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
           thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I
           have not known shall serve me.

19:018:044 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers
           shall submit themselves unto me.

19:018:045 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their
           close places.

19:018:046 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
           salvation be exalted.

19:018:047 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

19:018:048 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
           above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me
           from the violent man.

19:018:049 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
           heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

19:018:050 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
           his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

19:019:001 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
           sheweth his handywork.

19:019:002 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
           knowledge.

19:019:003 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not
           heard.

19:019:004 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words
           to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for
           the sun,

19:019:005 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and
           rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

19:019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit
           unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat
           thereof.

19:019:007 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
           testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

19:019:008 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
           commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

19:019:009 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the
           judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

19:019:010 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
           gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

19:019:011 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them
           there is great reward.

19:019:012 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
           faults.

19:019:013 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them
           not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I
           shall be innocent from the great transgression.

19:019:014 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
           acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.

19:020:001 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God
           of Jacob defend thee;

19:020:002 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
           Zion;

19:020:003 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
           Selah.

19:020:004 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
           counsel.

19:020:005 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God
           we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

19:020:006 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
           from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right
           hand.

19:020:007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will
           remember the name of the LORD our God.

19:020:008 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
           upright.

19:020:009 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

19:021:001 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy
           salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

19:021:002 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not
           withholden the request of his lips. Selah.

19:021:003 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
           settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

19:021:004 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
           days for ever and ever.

19:021:005 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast
           thou laid upon him.

19:021:006 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made
           him exceeding glad with thy countenance.

19:021:007 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of
           the most High he shall not be moved.

19:021:008 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand
           shall find out those that hate thee.

19:021:009 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine
           anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the
           fire shall devour them.

19:021:010 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed
           from among the children of men.

19:021:011 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a
           mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.

19:021:012 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou
           shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the
           face of them.

19:021:013 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing
           and praise thy power.

19:022:001 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
           from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

19:022:002 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in
           the night season, and am not silent.

19:022:003 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of
           Israel.

19:022:004 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst
           deliver them.

19:022:005 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in
           thee, and were not confounded.

19:022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised
           of the people.

19:022:007 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the
           lip, they shake the head, saying,

19:022:008 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him
           deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

19:022:009 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make
           me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.

19:022:010 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
           mother's belly.

19:022:011 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to
           help.

19:022:012 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have
           beset me round.

19:022:013 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
           roaring lion.

19:022:014 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:
           my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

19:022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue
           cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of
           death.

19:022:016 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
           inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

19:022:017 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

19:022:018 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
           vesture.

19:022:019 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee
           to help me.

19:022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of
           the dog.

19:022:021 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
           horns of the unicorns.

19:022:022 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
           congregation will I praise thee.

19:022:023 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
           glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

19:022:024 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
           afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he
           cried unto him, he heard.

19:022:025 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will
           pay my vows before them that fear him.

19:022:026 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the
           LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

19:022:027 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the
           LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before
           thee.

19:022:028 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among
           the nations.

19:022:029 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all
           they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none
           can keep alive his own soul.

19:022:030 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for
           a generation.

19:022:031 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
           people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

19:023:001 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

19:023:002 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me
           beside the still waters.

19:023:003 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of
           righteousness for his name's sake.

19:023:004 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
           I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
           staff they comfort me.

19:023:005 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
           enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

19:023:006 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
           life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

19:024:001 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world,
           and they that dwell therein.

19:024:002 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon
           the floods.

19:024:003 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand
           in his holy place?

19:024:004 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not
           lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

19:024:005 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness
           from the God of his salvation.

19:024:006 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy
           face, O Jacob. Selah.

19:024:007 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye
           everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

19:024:008 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the
           LORD mighty in battle.

19:024:009 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye
           everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

19:024:010 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King
           of glory. Selah.

19:025:001 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

19:025:002 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
           enemies triumph over me.

19:025:003 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be
           ashamed which transgress without cause.

19:025:004 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

19:025:005 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
           salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

19:025:006 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
           for they have been ever of old.

19:025:007 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
           according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness'
           sake, O LORD.

19:025:008 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners
           in the way.

19:025:009 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
           his way.

19:025:010 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as
           keep his covenant and his testimonies.

19:025:011 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
           great.

19:025:012 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in
           the way that he shall choose.

19:025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
           earth.

19:025:014 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will
           shew them his covenant.

19:025:015 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet
           out of the net.

19:025:016 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate
           and afflicted.

19:025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of
           my distresses.

19:025:018 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my
           sins.

19:025:019 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me
           with cruel hatred.

19:025:020 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I
           put my trust in thee.

19:025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

19:025:022 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

19:026:001 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have
           trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

19:026:002 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

19:026:003 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked
           in thy truth.

19:026:004 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
           dissemblers.

19:026:005 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit
           with the wicked.

19:026:006 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
           altar, O LORD:

19:026:007 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
           all thy wondrous works.

19:026:008 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
           where thine honour dwelleth.

19:026:009 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

19:026:010 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
           bribes.

19:026:011 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and
           be merciful unto me.

19:026:012 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I
           bless the LORD.

19:027:001 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
           LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

19:027:002 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
           to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

19:027:003 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not
           fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be
           confident.

19:027:004 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
           that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my
           life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his
           temple.

19:027:005 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
           in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set
           me up upon a rock.

19:027:006 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
           about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices
           of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

19:027:007 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon
           me, and answer me.

19:027:008 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee,
           Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

19:027:009 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in
           anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake
           me, O God of my salvation.

19:027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will
           take me up.

19:027:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because
           of mine enemies.

19:027:012 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
           witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out
           cruelty.

19:027:013 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of
           the LORD in the land of the living.

19:027:014 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
           thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

19:028:001 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me:
           lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down
           into the pit.

19:028:002 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when
           I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

19:028:003 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
           iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief
           is in their hearts.

19:028:004 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
           wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of
           their hands; render to them their desert.

19:028:005 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the
           operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build
           them up.

19:028:006 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
           supplications.

19:028:007 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in
           him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
           and with my song will I praise him.

19:028:008 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of
           his anointed.

19:028:009 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also,
           and lift them up for ever.

19:029:001 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
           strength.

19:029:002 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the
           LORD in the beauty of holiness.

19:029:003 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
           thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.

19:029:004 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is
           full of majesty.

19:029:005 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD
           breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.

19:029:006 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion
           like a young unicorn.

19:029:007 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.

19:029:008 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
           the wilderness of Kadesh.

19:029:009 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and
           discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one
           speak of his glory.

19:029:010 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King
           for ever.

19:029:011 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will
           bless his people with peace.

19:030:001 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and
           hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

19:030:002 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

19:030:003 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast
           kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

19:030:004 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
           remembrance of his holiness.

19:030:005 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
           weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

19:030:006 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

19:030:007 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand
           strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

19:030:008 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made
           supplication.

19:030:009 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
           Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

19:030:010 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

19:030:011 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast
           put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

19:030:012 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
           silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

19:031:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
           deliver me in thy righteousness.

19:031:002 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my
           strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.

19:031:003 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's
           sake lead me, and guide me.

19:031:004 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
           thou art my strength.

19:031:005 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O
           LORD God of truth.

19:031:006 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in
           the LORD.

19:031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast
           considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

19:031:008 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast
           set my feet in a large room.

19:031:009 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
           consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

19:031:010 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
           strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are
           consumed.

19:031:011 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among
           my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did
           see me without fled from me.

19:031:012 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
           vessel.

19:031:013 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:
           while they took counsel together against me, they devised to
           take away my life.

19:031:014 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.

19:031:015 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
           enemies, and from them that persecute me.

19:031:016 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
           mercies' sake.

19:031:017 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee:
           let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the
           grave.

19:031:018 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
           things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

19:031:019 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
           that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in
           thee before the sons of men!

19:031:020 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
           pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from
           the strife of tongues.

19:031:021 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
           kindness in a strong city.

19:031:022 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
           nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when
           I cried unto thee.

19:031:023 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth
           the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

19:031:024 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
           that hope in the LORD.

19:032:001 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
           covered.

19:032:002 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity,
           and in whose spirit there is no guile.

19:032:003 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
           the day long.

19:032:004 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
           turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

19:032:005 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
           hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD;
           and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

19:032:006 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a
           time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great
           waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

19:032:007 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
           thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

19:032:008 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
           shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.

19:032:009 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
           understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and
           bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

19:032:010 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in
           the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

19:032:011 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for
           joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

19:033:001 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for
           the upright.

19:033:002 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and
           an instrument of ten strings.

19:033:003 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

19:033:004 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done
           in truth.

19:033:005 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
           goodness of the LORD.

19:033:006 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the
           host of them by the breath of his mouth.

19:033:007 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he
           layeth up the depth in storehouses.

19:033:008 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of
           the world stand in awe of him.

19:033:009 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood
           fast.

19:033:010 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
           maketh the devices of the people of none effect.

19:033:011 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
           heart to all generations.

19:033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people
           whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

19:033:013 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of
           men.

19:033:014 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
           inhabitants of the earth.

19:033:015 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
           works.

19:033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty
           man is not delivered by much strength.

19:033:017 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
           any by his great strength.

19:033:018 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
           them that hope in his mercy;

19:033:019 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
           famine.

19:033:020 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.

19:033:021 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
           his holy name.

19:033:022 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in
           thee.

19:034:001 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall
           continually be in my mouth.

19:034:002 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall
           hear thereof, and be glad.

19:034:003 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name
           together.

19:034:004 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all
           my fears.

19:034:005 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
           not ashamed.

19:034:006 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out
           of all his troubles.

19:034:007 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear
           him, and delivereth them.

19:034:008 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
           trusteth in him.

19:034:009 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them
           that fear him.

19:034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek
           the LORD shall not want any good thing.

19:034:011 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear
           of the LORD.

19:034:012 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that
           he may see good?

19:034:013 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

19:034:014 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

19:034:015 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are
           open unto their cry.

19:034:016 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off
           the remembrance of them from the earth.

19:034:017 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them
           out of all their troubles.

19:034:018 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
           saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

19:034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD
           delivereth him out of them all.

19:034:020 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

19:034:021 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous
           shall be desolate.

19:034:022 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them
           that trust in him shall be desolate.

19:035:001 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
           against them that fight against me.

19:035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

19:035:003 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
           persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

19:035:004 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my
           soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that
           devise my hurt.

19:035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
           LORD chase them.

19:035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the
           LORD persecute them.

19:035:007 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,
           which without cause they have digged for my soul.

19:035:008 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net
           that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let
           him fall.

19:035:009 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in
           his salvation.

19:035:010 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
           deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea,
           the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?

19:035:011 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things
           that I knew not.

19:035:012 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

19:035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth:
           I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into
           mine own bosom.

19:035:014 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I
           bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.

19:035:015 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
           together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together
           against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased
           not:

19:035:016 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
           their teeth.

19:035:017 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
           destructions, my darling from the lions.

19:035:018 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will
           praise thee among much people.

19:035:019 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
           neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a
           cause.

19:035:020 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
           against them that are quiet in the land.

19:035:021 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
           aha, our eye hath seen it.

19:035:022 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not
           far from me.

19:035:023 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
           my God and my Lord.

19:035:024 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and
           let them not rejoice over me.

19:035:025 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let
           them not say, We have swallowed him up.

19:035:026 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
           rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and
           dishonour that magnify themselves against me.

19:035:027 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous
           cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be
           magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
           servant.

19:035:028 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy
           praise all the day long.

19:036:001 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that
           there is no fear of God before his eyes.

19:036:002 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity
           be found to be hateful.

19:036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left
           off to be wise, and to do good.

19:036:004 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
           that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

19:036:005 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
           reacheth unto the clouds.

19:036:006 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments
           are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

19:036:007 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
           children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

19:036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy
           house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy
           pleasures.

19:036:009 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we
           see light.

19:036:010 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and
           thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

19:036:011 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the
           hand of the wicked remove me.

19:036:012 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,
           and shall not be able to rise.

19:037:001 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
           against the workers of iniquity.

19:037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as
           the green herb.

19:037:003 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the
           land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

19:037:004 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
           desires of thine heart.

19:037:005 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
           bring it to pass.

19:037:006 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and
           thy judgment as the noonday.

19:037:007 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
           because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man
           who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

19:037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any
           wise to do evil.

19:037:009 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
           LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

19:037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
           shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

19:037:011 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
           themselves in the abundance of peace.

19:037:012 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him
           with his teeth.

19:037:013 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
           coming.

19:037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
           to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of
           upright conversation.

19:037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
           shall be broken.

19:037:016 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches
           of many wicked.

19:037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
           upholdeth the righteous.

19:037:018 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their
           inheritance shall be for ever.

19:037:019 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
           famine they shall be satisfied.

19:037:020 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
           be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall
           they consume away.

19:037:021 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
           sheweth mercy, and giveth.

19:037:022 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and
           they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.

19:037:023 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
           delighteth in his way.

19:037:024 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the
           LORD upholdeth him with his hand.

19:037:025 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
           righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

19:037:026 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

19:037:027 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

19:037:028 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints;
           they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall
           be cut off.

19:037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
           ever.

19:037:030 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
           talketh of judgment.

19:037:031 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
           slide.

19:037:032 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

19:037:033 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when
           he is judged.

19:037:034 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
           inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see
           it.

19:037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
           like a green bay tree.

19:037:036 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him,
           but he could not be found.

19:037:037 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
           that man is peace.

19:037:038 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
           the wicked shall be cut off.

19:037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
           strength in the time of trouble.

19:037:040 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall
           deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they
           trust in him.

19:038:001 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy
           hot displeasure.

19:038:002 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me
           sore.

19:038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
           neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

19:038:004 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy
           burden they are too heavy for me.

19:038:005 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

19:038:006 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the
           day long.

19:038:007 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is
           no soundness in my flesh.

19:038:008 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
           disquietness of my heart.

19:038:009 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid
           from thee.

19:038:010 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of
           mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

19:038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
           kinsmen stand afar off.

19:038:012 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
           that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine
           deceits all the day long.

19:038:013 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
           openeth not his mouth.

19:038:014 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are
           no reproofs.

19:038:015 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

19:038:016 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over
           me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

19:038:017 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before
           me.

19:038:018 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

19:038:019 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they
           that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

19:038:020 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
           because I follow the thing that good is.

19:038:021 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

19:038:022 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.

19:039:001 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
           tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked
           is before me.

19:039:002 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and
           my sorrow was stirred.

19:039:003 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire
           burned: then spake I with my tongue,

19:039:004 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,
           what it is: that I may know how frail I am.

19:039:005 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age
           is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state
           is altogether vanity. Selah.

19:039:006 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
           disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who
           shall gather them.

19:039:007 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.

19:039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the
           reproach of the foolish.

19:039:009 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.

19:039:010 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
           thine hand.

19:039:011 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
           makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every
           man is vanity. Selah.

19:039:012 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
           peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a
           sojourner, as all my fathers were.

19:039:013 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence,
           and be no more.

19:040:001 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
           heard my cry.

19:040:002 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
           clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

19:040:003 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our
           God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

19:040:004 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
           respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

19:040:005 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
           done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be
           reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak
           of them, they are more than can be numbered.

19:040:006 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast
           thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not
           required.

19:040:007 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
           written of me,

19:040:008 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
           heart.

19:040:009 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I
           have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

19:040:010 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
           declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not
           concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great
           congregation.

19:040:011 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
           lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

19:040:012 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities
           have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
           they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart
           faileth me.

19:040:013 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help
           me.

19:040:014 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
           soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to
           shame that wish me evil.

19:040:015 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
           me, Aha, aha.

19:040:016 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
           such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be
           magnified.

19:040:017 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou
           art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

19:041:001 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver
           him in time of trouble.

19:041:002 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall
           be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto
           the will of his enemies.

19:041:003 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
           wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

19:041:004 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
           sinned against thee.

19:041:005 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
           perish?

19:041:006 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart
           gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth
           it.

19:041:007 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do
           they devise my hurt.

19:041:008 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now
           that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

19:041:009 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did
           eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

19:041:010 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
           may requite them.

19:041:011 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
           not triumph over me.

19:041:012 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and
           settest me before thy face for ever.

19:041:013 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
           everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

19:042:001 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
           after thee, O God.

19:042:002 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I
           come and appear before God?

19:042:003 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they
           continually say unto me, Where is thy God?

19:042:004 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I
           had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of
           God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that
           kept holyday.

19:042:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
           in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the
           help of his countenance.

19:042:006 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I
           remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites,
           from the hill Mizar.

19:042:007 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all
           thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

19:042:008 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time,
           and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto
           the God of my life.

19:042:009 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why
           go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

19:042:010 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
           they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?

19:042:011 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
           within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who
           is the health of my countenance, and my God.

19:043:001 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:
           O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

19:043:002 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me
           off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

19:043:003 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them
           bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

19:043:004 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding
           joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

19:043:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
           within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the
           health of my countenance, and my God.

19:044:001 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
           what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

19:044:002 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and
           plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast
           them out.

19:044:003 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
           neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and
           thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou
           hadst a favour unto them.

19:044:004 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

19:044:005 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name
           will we tread them under that rise up against us.

19:044:006 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save
           me.

19:044:007 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
           shame that hated us.

19:044:008 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for
           ever. Selah.

19:044:009 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not
           forth with our armies.

19:044:010 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which
           hate us spoil for themselves.

19:044:011 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
           scattered us among the heathen.

19:044:012 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
           wealth by their price.

19:044:013 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
           derision to them that are round about us.

19:044:014 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the
           head among the people.

19:044:015 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my
           face hath covered me,

19:044:016 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by
           reason of the enemy and avenger.

19:044:017 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
           neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

19:044:018 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
           from thy way;

19:044:019 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
           covered us with the shadow of death.

19:044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
           hands to a strange god;

19:044:021 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of
           the heart.

19:044:022 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are
           counted as sheep for the slaughter.

19:044:023 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
           ever.

19:044:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
           and our oppression?

19:044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth
           unto the earth.

19:044:026 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.

19:045:001 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things
           which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a
           ready writer.

19:045:002 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into
           thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

19:045:003 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory
           and thy majesty.

19:045:004 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
           meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach
           thee terrible things.

19:045:005 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
           whereby the people fall under thee.

19:045:006 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
           kingdom is a right sceptre.

19:045:007 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore
           God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
           above thy fellows.

19:045:008 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
           the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

19:045:009 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy
           right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

19:045:010 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
           forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;

19:045:011 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy
           Lord; and worship thou him.

19:045:012 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the
           rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.

19:045:013 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
           wrought gold.

19:045:014 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework:
           the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought
           unto thee.

19:045:015 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall
           enter into the king's palace.

19:045:016 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest
           make princes in all the earth.

19:045:017 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
           therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

19:046:001 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
           trouble.

19:046:002 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
           though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

19:046:003 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
           mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

19:046:004 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city
           of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

19:046:005 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall
           help her, and that right early.

19:046:006 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his
           voice, the earth melted.

19:046:007 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
           Selah.

19:046:008 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath
           made in the earth.

19:046:009 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
           the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the
           chariot in the fire.

19:046:010 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
           heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

19:046:011 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
           Selah.

19:047:001 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the
           voice of triumph.

19:047:002 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over
           all the earth.

19:047:003 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
           feet.

19:047:004 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of
           Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

19:047:005 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
           trumpet.

19:047:006 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
           sing praises.

19:047:007 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
           understanding.

19:047:008 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of
           his holiness.

19:047:009 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the
           people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth
           belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.

19:048:001 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of
           our God, in the mountain of his holiness.

19:048:002 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount
           Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

19:048:003 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

19:048:004 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

19:048:005 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
           hasted away.

19:048:006 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
           travail.

19:048:007 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

19:048:008 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
           hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
           Selah.

19:048:009 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of
           thy temple.

19:048:010 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends
           of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

19:048:011 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
           because of thy judgments.

19:048:012 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
           thereof.

19:048:013 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
           tell it to the generation following.

19:048:014 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our
           guide even unto death.

19:049:001 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
           world:

19:049:002 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

19:049:003 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
           shall be of understanding.

19:049:004 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark
           saying upon the harp.

19:049:005 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity
           of my heels shall compass me about?

19:049:006 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
           multitude of their riches;

19:049:007 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to
           God a ransom for him:

19:049:008 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth
           for ever:)

19:049:009 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

19:049:010 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
           brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

19:049:011 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
           ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call
           their lands after their own names.

19:049:012 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
           beasts that perish.

19:049:013 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve
           their sayings. Selah.

19:049:014 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on
           them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the
           morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from
           their dwelling.

19:049:015 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for
           he shall receive me. Selah.

19:049:016 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of
           his house is increased;

19:049:017 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall
           not descend after him.

19:049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise
           thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

19:049:019 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
           see light.

19:049:020 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the
           beasts that perish.

19:050:001 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the
           earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

19:050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

19:050:003 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
           devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
           about him.

19:050:004 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth,
           that he may judge his people.

19:050:005 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
           covenant with me by sacrifice.

19:050:006 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is
           judge himself. Selah.

19:050:007 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will
           testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.

19:050:008 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
           offerings, to have been continually before me.

19:050:009 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of
           thy folds.

19:050:010 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
           thousand hills.

19:050:011 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of
           the field are mine.

19:050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is
           mine, and the fulness thereof.

19:050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

19:050:014 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
           High:

19:050:015 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,
           and thou shalt glorify me.

19:050:016 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
           my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
           mouth?

19:050:017 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
           thee.

19:050:018 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
           hast been partaker with adulterers.

19:050:019 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

19:050:020 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
           thine own mother's son.

19:050:021 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou
           thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I
           will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

19:050:022 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
           pieces, and there be none to deliver.

19:050:023 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
           his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

19:051:001 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
           according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
           transgressions.

19:051:002 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
           sin.

19:051:003 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
           me.

19:051:004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in
           thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
           and be clear when thou judgest.

19:051:005 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
           conceive me.

19:051:006 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
           hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

19:051:007 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
           shall be whiter than snow.

19:051:008 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou
           hast broken may rejoice.

19:051:009 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

19:051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
           within me.

19:051:011 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy
           spirit from me.

19:051:012 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with
           thy free spirit.

19:051:013 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
           converted unto thee.

19:051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
           salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
           righteousness.

19:051:015 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
           praise.

19:051:016 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
           delightest not in burnt offering.

19:051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
           contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

19:051:018 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls
           of Jerusalem.

19:051:019 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of
           righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
           then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

19:052:001 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the
           goodness of God endureth continually.

19:052:002 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
           deceitfully.

19:052:003 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to
           speak righteousness. Selah.

19:052:004 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

19:052:005 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
           away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee
           out of the land of the living. Selah.

19:052:006 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at
           him:

19:052:007 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but
           trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
           himself in his wickedness.

19:052:008 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust
           in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

19:052:009 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
           will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.

19:053:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
           they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that
           doeth good.

19:053:002 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
           if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.

19:053:003 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
           filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

19:053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
           people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

19:053:005 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
           scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou
           hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.

19:053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When
           God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall
           rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

19:054:001 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

19:054:002 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

19:054:003 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek
           after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

19:054:004 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold
           my soul.

19:054:005 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
           truth.

19:054:006 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
           LORD; for it is good.

19:054:007 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
           seen his desire upon mine enemies.

19:055:001 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
           supplication.

19:055:002 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make
           a noise;

19:055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression
           of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath
           they hate me.

19:055:004 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death
           are fallen upon me.

19:055:005 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
           overwhelmed me.

19:055:006 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I
           fly away, and be at rest.

19:055:007 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
           Selah.

19:055:008 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

19:055:009 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
           violence and strife in the city.

19:055:010 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
           mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

19:055:011 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart
           not from her streets.

19:055:012 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
           borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify
           himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

19:055:013 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
           acquaintance.

19:055:014 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of
           God in company.

19:055:015 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into
           hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

19:055:016 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

19:055:017 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
           and he shall hear my voice.

19:055:018 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
           against me: for there were many with me.

19:055:019 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
           Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not
           God.

19:055:020 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
           him: he hath broken his covenant.

19:055:021 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was
           in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they
           drawn swords.

19:055:022 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
           shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

19:055:023 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
           destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half
           their days; but I will trust in thee.

19:056:001 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
           fighting daily oppresseth me.

19:056:002 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that
           fight against me, O thou most High.

19:056:003 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

19:056:004 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I
           will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

19:056:005 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against
           me for evil.

19:056:006 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they
           mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

19:056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
           people, O God.

19:056:008 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
           are they not in thy book?

19:056:009 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this
           I know; for God is for me.

19:056:010 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
           word.

19:056:011 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can
           do unto me.

19:056:012 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

19:056:013 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
           deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in
           the light of the living?

19:057:001 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
           trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make
           my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.

19:057:002 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
           things for me.

19:057:003 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of
           him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his
           mercy and his truth.

19:057:004 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set
           on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
           arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

19:057:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be
           above all the earth.

19:057:006 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
           they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they
           are fallen themselves. Selah.

19:057:007 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and
           give praise.

19:057:008 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will
           awake early.

19:057:009 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
           thee among the nations.

19:057:010 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto
           the clouds.

19:057:011 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
           above all the earth.

19:058:001 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
           uprightly, O ye sons of men?

19:058:002 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of
           your hands in the earth.

19:058:003 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon
           as they be born, speaking lies.

19:058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like
           the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

19:058:005 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming
           never so wisely.

19:058:006 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great
           teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

19:058:007 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
           bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in
           pieces.

19:058:008 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away:
           like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the
           sun.

19:058:009 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away
           as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

19:058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
           shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

19:058:011 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
           righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

19:059:001 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them
           that rise up against me.

19:059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from
           bloody men.

19:059:003 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered
           against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

19:059:004 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to
           help me, and behold.

19:059:005 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake
           to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked
           transgressors. Selah.

19:059:006 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
           round about the city.

19:059:007 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their
           lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

19:059:008 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
           heathen in derision.

19:059:009 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
           defence.

19:059:010 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my
           desire upon mine enemies.

19:059:011 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy
           power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

19:059:012 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let
           them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying
           which they speak.

19:059:013 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and
           let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the
           earth. Selah.

19:059:014 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like
           a dog, and go round about the city.

19:059:015 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be
           not satisfied.

19:059:016 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
           mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge
           in the day of my trouble.

19:059:017 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
           and the God of my mercy.

19:060:001 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou
           hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

19:060:002 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal
           the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

19:060:003 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to
           drink the wine of astonishment.

19:060:004 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may
           be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

19:060:005 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand,
           and hear me.

19:060:006 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
           Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

19:060:007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
           strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

19:060:008 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe:
           Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

19:060:009 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
           Edom?

19:060:010 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O
           God, which didst not go out with our armies?

19:060:011 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

19:060:012 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
           tread down our enemies.

19:061:001 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

19:061:002 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart
           is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

19:061:003 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from
           the enemy.

19:061:004 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the
           covert of thy wings. Selah.

19:061:005 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the
           heritage of those that fear thy name.

19:061:006 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many
           generations.

19:061:007 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,
           which may preserve him.

19:061:008 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
           perform my vows.

19:062:001 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.

19:062:002 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall
           not be greatly moved.

19:062:003 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
           slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a
           tottering fence.

19:062:004 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
           delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse
           inwardly. Selah.

19:062:005 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from
           him.

19:062:006 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall
           not be moved.

19:062:007 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,
           and my refuge, is in God.

19:062:008 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart
           before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

19:062:009 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree
           are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether
           lighter than vanity.

19:062:010 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
           riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

19:062:011 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
           belongeth unto God.

19:062:012 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to
           every man according to his work.

19:063:001 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
           thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
           thirsty land, where no water is;

19:063:002 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
           sanctuary.

19:063:003 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
           praise thee.

19:063:004 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands
           in thy name.

19:063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
           mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:

19:063:006 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
           night watches.

19:063:007 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy
           wings will I rejoice.

19:063:008 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth
           me.

19:063:009 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
           lower parts of the earth.

19:063:010 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for
           foxes.

19:063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by
           him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall
           be stopped.

19:064:001 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear
           of the enemy.

19:064:002 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
           insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

19:064:003 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to
           shoot their arrows, even bitter words:

19:064:004 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they
           shoot at him, and fear not.

19:064:005 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of
           laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

19:064:006 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
           both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart,
           is deep.

19:064:007 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they
           be wounded.

19:064:008 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
           all that see them shall flee away.

19:064:009 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
           they shall wisely consider of his doing.

19:064:010 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in
           him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

19:065:001 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall
           the vow be performed.

19:065:002 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

19:065:003 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou
           shalt purge them away.

19:065:004 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
           unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be
           satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy
           temple.

19:065:005 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God
           of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of
           the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

19:065:006 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
           with power:

19:065:007 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their
           waves, and the tumult of the people.

19:065:008 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
           tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening
           to rejoice.

19:065:009 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly
           enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water:
           thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

19:065:010 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
           furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou
           blessest the springing thereof.

19:065:011 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
           fatness.

19:065:012 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little
           hills rejoice on every side.

19:065:013 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
           covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

19:066:001 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

19:066:002 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

19:066:003 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
           greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves
           unto thee.

19:066:004 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee;
           they shall sing to thy name. Selah.

19:066:005 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing
           toward the children of men.

19:066:006 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood
           on foot: there did we rejoice in him.

19:066:007 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:
           let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

19:066:008 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise
           to be heard:

19:066:009 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to
           be moved.

19:066:010 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver
           is tried.

19:066:011 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon
           our loins.

19:066:012 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
           fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a
           wealthy place.

19:066:013 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee
           my vows,

19:066:014 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I
           was in trouble.

19:066:015 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
           incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

19:066:016 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what
           he hath done for my soul.

19:066:017 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
           tongue.

19:066:018 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

19:066:019 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of
           my prayer.

19:066:020 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
           mercy from me.

19:067:001 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
           shine upon us; Selah.

19:067:002 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among
           all nations.

19:067:003 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
           thee.

19:067:004 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt
           judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon
           earth. Selah.

19:067:005 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
           thee.

19:067:006 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own
           God, shall bless us.

19:067:007 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear
           him.

19:068:001 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also
           that hate him flee before him.

19:068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
           before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of
           God.

19:068:003 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God:
           yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

19:068:004 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth
           upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

19:068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God
           in his holy habitation.

19:068:006 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those
           which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry
           land.

19:068:007 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou
           didst march through the wilderness; Selah:

19:068:008 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of
           God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the
           God of Israel.

19:068:009 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
           confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.

19:068:010 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast
           prepared of thy goodness for the poor.

19:068:011 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that
           published it.

19:068:012 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
           divided the spoil.

19:068:013 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the
           wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with
           yellow gold.

19:068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow
           in Salmon.

19:068:015 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
           hill of Bashan.

19:068:016 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God
           desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.

19:068:017 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
           angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy
           place.

19:068:018 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
           thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious
           also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.

19:068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
           the God of our salvation. Selah.

19:068:020 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
           Lord belong the issues from death.

19:068:021 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy
           scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

19:068:022 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
           people again from the depths of the sea:

19:068:023 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and
           the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

19:068:024 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God,
           my King, in the sanctuary.

19:068:025 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
           after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.

19:068:026 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
           fountain of Israel.

19:068:027 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of
           Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the
           princes of Naphtali.

19:068:028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that
           which thou hast wrought for us.

19:068:029 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
           unto thee.

19:068:030 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls,
           with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself
           with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in
           war.

19:068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch
           out her hands unto God.

19:068:032 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto
           the Lord; Selah:

19:068:033 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of
           old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

19:068:034 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel,
           and his strength is in the clouds.

19:068:035 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of
           Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.
           Blessed be God.

19:069:001 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.

19:069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come
           into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

19:069:003 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail
           while I wait for my God.

19:069:004 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
           mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies
           wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not
           away.

19:069:005 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid
           from thee.

19:069:006 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be
           ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be
           confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

19:069:007 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered
           my face.

19:069:008 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
           mother's children.

19:069:009 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the
           reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

19:069:010 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to
           my reproach.

19:069:011 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
           them.

19:069:012 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
           of the drunkards.

19:069:013 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an
           acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me,
           in the truth of thy salvation.

19:069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be
           delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

19:069:015 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep
           swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

19:069:016 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
           according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

19:069:017 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
           hear me speedily.

19:069:018 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
           mine enemies.

19:069:019 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
           mine adversaries are all before thee.

19:069:020 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and
           I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for
           comforters, but I found none.

19:069:021 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
           me vinegar to drink.

19:069:022 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
           should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

19:069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
           loins continually to shake.

19:069:024 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful
           anger take hold of them.

19:069:025 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
           tents.

19:069:026 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk
           to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

19:069:027 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into
           thy righteousness.

19:069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
           written with the righteous.

19:069:029 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me
           up on high.

19:069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify
           him with thanksgiving.

19:069:031 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
           that hath horns and hoofs.

19:069:032 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall
           live that seek God.

19:069:033 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his
           prisoners.

19:069:034 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
           that moveth therein.

19:069:035 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah:
           that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

19:069:036 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that
           love his name shall dwell therein.

19:070:001 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O
           LORD.

19:070:002 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul:
           let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire
           my hurt.

19:070:003 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
           Aha, aha.

19:070:004 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and
           let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be
           magnified.

19:070:005 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art
           my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

19:071:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
           confusion.

19:071:002 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape:
           incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

19:071:003 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually
           resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art
           my rock and my fortress.

19:071:004 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of
           the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

19:071:005 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
           youth.

19:071:006 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
           took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be
           continually of thee.

19:071:007 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.

19:071:008 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
           the day.

19:071:009 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
           strength faileth.

19:071:010 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for
           my soul take counsel together,

19:071:011 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for
           there is none to deliver him.

19:071:012 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

19:071:013 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
           soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that
           seek my hurt.

19:071:014 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
           more.

19:071:015 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
           all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.

19:071:016 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
           of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

19:071:017 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
           declared thy wondrous works.

19:071:018 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
           until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy
           power to every one that is to come.

19:071:019 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done
           great things: O God, who is like unto thee!

19:071:020 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
           quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths
           of the earth.

19:071:021 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every
           side.

19:071:022 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O
           my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One
           of Israel.

19:071:023 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
           soul, which thou hast redeemed.

19:071:024 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day
           long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto
           shame, that seek my hurt.

19:072:001 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
           the king's son.

19:072:002 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor
           with judgment.

19:072:003 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
           hills, by righteousness.

19:072:004 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the
           children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the
           oppressor.

19:072:005 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
           throughout all generations.

19:072:006 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers
           that water the earth.

19:072:007 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of
           peace so long as the moon endureth.

19:072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the
           river unto the ends of the earth.

19:072:009 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and
           his enemies shall lick the dust.

19:072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
           the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

19:072:011 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
           serve him.

19:072:012 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
           and him that hath no helper.

19:072:013 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
           the needy.

19:072:014 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
           precious shall their blood be in his sight.

19:072:015 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
           Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and
           daily shall he be praised.

19:072:016 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
           the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and
           they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

19:072:017 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as
           long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations
           shall call him blessed.

19:072:018 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
           wondrous things.

19:072:019 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
           earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

19:072:020 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

19:073:001 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
           heart.

19:073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well
           nigh slipped.

19:073:003 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
           the wicked.

19:073:004 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
           firm.

19:073:005 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
           like other men.

19:073:006 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
           covereth them as a garment.

19:073:007 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
           could wish.

19:073:008 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
           they speak loftily.

19:073:009 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
           walketh through the earth.

19:073:010 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup
           are wrung out to them.

19:073:011 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
           most High?

19:073:012 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
           increase in riches.

19:073:013 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands
           in innocency.

19:073:014 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
           morning.

19:073:015 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against
           the generation of thy children.

19:073:016 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

19:073:017 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I
           their end.

19:073:018 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
           them down into destruction.

19:073:019 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
           utterly consumed with terrors.

19:073:020 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest,
           thou shalt despise their image.

19:073:021 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

19:073:022 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.

19:073:023 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me
           by my right hand.

19:073:024 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
           to glory.

19:073:025 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
           that I desire beside thee.

19:073:026 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
           heart, and my portion for ever.

19:073:027 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
           destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

19:073:028 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
           in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

19:074:001 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine
           anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

19:074:002 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old;
           the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this
           mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

19:074:003 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
           the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

19:074:004 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set
           up their ensigns for signs.

19:074:005 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
           thick trees.

19:074:006 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with
           axes and hammers.

19:074:007 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
           casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

19:074:008 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
           have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

19:074:009 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is
           there among us any that knoweth how long.

19:074:010 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
           blaspheme thy name for ever?

19:074:011 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it
           out of thy bosom.

19:074:012 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of
           the earth.

19:074:013 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
           heads of the dragons in the waters.

19:074:014 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him
           to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

19:074:015 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
           mighty rivers.

19:074:016 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared
           the light and the sun.

19:074:017 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
           summer and winter.

19:074:018 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and
           that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

19:074:019 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
           the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

19:074:020 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the
           earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

19:074:021 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
           praise thy name.

19:074:022 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
           man reproacheth thee daily.

19:074:023 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those
           that rise up against thee increaseth continually.

19:075:001 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give
           thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

19:075:002 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

19:075:003 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I
           bear up the pillars of it. Selah.

19:075:004 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
           Lift not up the horn:

19:075:005 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.

19:075:006 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
           nor from the south.

19:075:007 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
           another.

19:075:008 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is
           red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same:
           but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring
           them out, and drink them.

19:075:009 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
           Jacob.

19:075:010 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
           of the righteous shall be exalted.

19:076:001 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.

19:076:002 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in
           Zion.

19:076:003 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the
           sword, and the battle. Selah.

19:076:004 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of
           prey.

19:076:005 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and
           none of the men of might have found their hands.

19:076:006 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
           cast into a dead sleep.

19:076:007 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy
           sight when once thou art angry?

19:076:008 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
           feared, and was still,

19:076:009 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
           Selah.

19:076:010 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
           wrath shalt thou restrain.

19:076:011 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round
           about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

19:076:012 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
           kings of the earth.

19:077:001 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice;
           and he gave ear unto me.

19:077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
           night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

19:077:003 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my
           spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

19:077:004 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
           speak.

19:077:005 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

19:077:006 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with
           mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

19:077:007 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
           more?

19:077:008 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
           evermore?

19:077:009 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up
           his tender mercies? Selah.

19:077:010 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the
           years of the right hand of the most High.

19:077:011 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
           thy wonders of old.

19:077:012 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

19:077:013 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as
           our God?

19:077:014 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
           strength among the people.

19:077:015 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of
           Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

19:077:016 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
           afraid: the depths also were troubled.

19:077:017 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine
           arrows also went abroad.

19:077:018 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings
           lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.

19:077:019 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and
           thy footsteps are not known.

19:077:020 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
           Aaron.

19:078:001 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the
           words of my mouth.

19:078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings
           of old:

19:078:003 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

19:078:004 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
           generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength,
           and his wonderful works that he hath done.

19:078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law
           in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should
           make them known to their children:

19:078:006 That the generation to come might know them, even the children
           which should be born; who should arise and declare them to
           their children:

19:078:007 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the
           works of God, but keep his commandments:

19:078:008 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
           generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and
           whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

19:078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows,
           turned back in the day of battle.

19:078:010 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
           law;

19:078:011 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

19:078:012 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
           land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

19:078:013 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he
           made the waters to stand as an heap.

19:078:014 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the
           night with a light of fire.

19:078:015 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as
           out of the great depths.

19:078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
           run down like rivers.

19:078:017 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most
           High in the wilderness.

19:078:018 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
           lust.

19:078:019 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a
           table in the wilderness?

19:078:020 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
           streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide
           flesh for his people?

19:078:021 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
           kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

19:078:022 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
           salvation:

19:078:023 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
           doors of heaven,

19:078:024 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
           of the corn of heaven.

19:078:025 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

19:078:026 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
           he brought in the south wind.

19:078:027 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
           like as the sand of the sea:

19:078:028 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about
           their habitations.

19:078:029 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
           own desire;

19:078:030 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
           was yet in their mouths,

19:078:031 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
           and smote down the chosen men of Israel.

19:078:032 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
           wondrous works.

19:078:033 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
           in trouble.

19:078:034 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
           enquired early after God.

19:078:035 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
           their redeemer.

19:078:036 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
           lied unto him with their tongues.

19:078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
           stedfast in his covenant.

19:078:038 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
           destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
           and did not stir up all his wrath.

19:078:039 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that
           passeth away, and cometh not again.

19:078:040 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
           in the desert!

19:078:041 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy
           One of Israel.

19:078:042 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered
           them from the enemy.

19:078:043 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
           field of Zoan.

19:078:044 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
           they could not drink.

19:078:045 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
           and frogs, which destroyed them.

19:078:046 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
           labour unto the locust.

19:078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
           with frost.

19:078:048 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
           hot thunderbolts.

19:078:049 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
           indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.

19:078:050 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from
           death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

19:078:051 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
           strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

19:078:052 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided
           them in the wilderness like a flock.

19:078:053 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the
           sea overwhelmed their enemies.

19:078:054 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to
           this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

19:078:055 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
           inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in
           their tents.

19:078:056 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
           his testimonies:

19:078:057 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
           they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

19:078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and
           moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

19:078:059 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
           Israel:

19:078:060 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
           placed among men;

19:078:061 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
           the enemy's hand.

19:078:062 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth
           with his inheritance.

19:078:063 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
           given to marriage.

19:078:064 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
           lamentation.

19:078:065 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty
           man that shouteth by reason of wine.

19:078:066 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
           perpetual reproach.

19:078:067 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not
           the tribe of Ephraim:

19:078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

19:078:069 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
           which he hath established for ever.

19:078:070 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
           sheepfolds:

19:078:071 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to
           feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

19:078:072 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
           guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

19:079:001 O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
           temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

19:079:002 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat
           unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the
           beasts of the earth.

19:079:003 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
           and there was none to bury them.

19:079:004 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and
           derision to them that are round about us.

19:079:005 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy
           jealousy burn like fire?

19:079:006 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,
           and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

19:079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling
           place.

19:079:008 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
           mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

19:079:009 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name:
           and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.

19:079:010 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him
           be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of
           the blood of thy servants which is shed.

19:079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
           the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are
           appointed to die;

19:079:012 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
           their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

19:079:013 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee
           thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all
           generations.

19:080:001 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like
           a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine
           forth.

19:080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
           and come and save us.

19:080:003 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we
           shall be saved.

19:080:004 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
           prayer of thy people?

19:080:005 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them
           tears to drink in great measure.

19:080:006 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
           laugh among themselves.

19:080:007 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine;
           and we shall be saved.

19:080:008 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
           heathen, and planted it.

19:080:009 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take
           deep root, and it filled the land.

19:080:010 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
           thereof were like the goodly cedars.

19:080:011 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto
           the river.

19:080:012 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
           which pass by the way do pluck her?

19:080:013 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
           the field doth devour it.

19:080:014 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from
           heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

19:080:015 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
           branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

19:080:016 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
           rebuke of thy countenance.

19:080:017 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son
           of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

19:080:018 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
           upon thy name.

19:080:019 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine;
           and we shall be saved.

19:081:001 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
           God of Jacob.

19:081:002 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
           with the psaltery.

19:081:003 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
           our solemn feast day.

19:081:004 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of
           Jacob.

19:081:005 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
           through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I
           understood not.

19:081:006 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were
           delivered from the pots.

19:081:007 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered
           thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the
           waters of Meribah. Selah.

19:081:008 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
           thou wilt hearken unto me;

19:081:009 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou
           worship any strange god.

19:081:010 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
           Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

19:081:011 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
           none of me.

19:081:012 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked
           in their own counsels.

19:081:013 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
           in my ways!

19:081:014 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
           against their adversaries.

19:081:015 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
           him: but their time should have endured for ever.

19:081:016 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
           with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

19:082:001 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth
           among the gods.

19:082:002 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
           wicked? Selah.

19:082:003 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted
           and needy.

19:082:004 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
           wicked.

19:082:005 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
           darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

19:082:006 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the
           most High.

19:082:007 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

19:082:008 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
           nations.

19:083:001 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
           still, O God.

19:083:002 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
           have lifted up the head.

19:083:003 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and
           consulted against thy hidden ones.

19:083:004 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
           nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

19:083:005 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
           confederate against thee:

19:083:006 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
           Hagarenes;

19:083:007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
           inhabitants of Tyre;

19:083:008 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children
           of Lot. Selah.

19:083:009 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to
           Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

19:083:010 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.

19:083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
           princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

19:083:012 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
           possession.

19:083:013 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
           wind.

19:083:014 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
           mountains on fire;

19:083:015 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
           thy storm.

19:083:016 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
           LORD.

19:083:017 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
           put to shame, and perish:

19:083:018 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
           the most high over all the earth.

19:084:001 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

19:084:002 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
           LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

19:084:003 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest
           for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O
           LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.

19:084:004 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
           praising thee. Selah.

19:084:005 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart
           are the ways of them.

19:084:006 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the
           rain also filleth the pools.

19:084:007 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
           appeareth before God.

19:084:008 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
           Selah.

19:084:009 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
           anointed.

19:084:010 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had
           rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell
           in the tents of wickedness.

19:084:011 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace
           and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
           uprightly.

19:084:012 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

19:085:001 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast
           brought back the captivity of Jacob.

19:085:002 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast
           covered all their sin. Selah.

19:085:003 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself
           from the fierceness of thine anger.

19:085:004 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward
           us to cease.

19:085:005 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
           anger to all generations?

19:085:006 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
           thee?

19:085:007 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

19:085:008 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak
           peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not
           turn again to folly.

19:085:009 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory
           may dwell in our land.

19:085:010 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
           kissed each other.

19:085:011 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
           look down from heaven.

19:085:012 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land
           shall yield her increase.

19:085:013 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
           of his steps.

19:086:001 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

19:086:002 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy
           servant that trusteth in thee.

19:086:003 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

19:086:004 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I
           lift up my soul.

19:086:005 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous
           in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

19:086:006 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of
           my supplications.

19:086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
           answer me.

19:086:008 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither
           are there any works like unto thy works.

19:086:009 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
           thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

19:086:010 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
           alone.

19:086:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
           heart to fear thy name.

19:086:012 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I
           will glorify thy name for evermore.

19:086:013 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
           soul from the lowest hell.

19:086:014 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
           violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee
           before them.

19:086:015 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
           longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

19:086:016 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto
           thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

19:086:017 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,
           and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and
           comforted me.

19:087:001 His foundation is in the holy mountains.

19:087:002 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings
           of Jacob.

19:087:003 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

19:087:004 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
           behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born
           there.

19:087:005 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in
           her: and the highest himself shall establish her.

19:087:006 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
           man was born there. Selah.

19:087:007 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be
           there: all my springs are in thee.

19:088:001 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
           thee:

19:088:002 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;

19:088:003 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto
           the grave.

19:088:004 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a
           man that hath no strength:

19:088:005 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
           whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy
           hand.

19:088:006 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the
           deeps.

19:088:007 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with
           all thy waves. Selah.

19:088:008 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast
           made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot
           come forth.

19:088:009 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
           daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

19:088:010 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
           praise thee? Selah.

19:088:011 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
           faithfulness in destruction?

19:088:012 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness
           in the land of forgetfulness?

19:088:013 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall
           my prayer prevent thee.

19:088:014 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
           from me?

19:088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I
           suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

19:088:016 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

19:088:017 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
           about together.

19:088:018 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
           acquaintance into darkness.

19:089:001 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth
           will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

19:089:002 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
           faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

19:089:003 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David
           my servant,

19:089:004 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
           all generations. Selah.

19:089:005 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
           faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

19:089:006 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
           the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

19:089:007 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and
           to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

19:089:008 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or
           to thy faithfulness round about thee?

19:089:009 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof
           arise, thou stillest them.

19:089:010 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
           hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.

19:089:011 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the
           world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

19:089:012 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and
           Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.

19:089:013 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
           right hand.

19:089:014 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy
           and truth shall go before thy face.

19:089:015 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
           walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

19:089:016 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
           righteousness shall they be exalted.

19:089:017 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour
           our horn shall be exalted.

19:089:018 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
           king.

19:089:019 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I
           have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one
           chosen out of the people.

19:089:020 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I
           anointed him:

19:089:021 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
           strengthen him.

19:089:022 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
           afflict him.

19:089:023 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
           that hate him.

19:089:024 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my
           name shall his horn be exalted.

19:089:025 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
           rivers.

19:089:026 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
           of my salvation.

19:089:027 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of
           the earth.

19:089:028 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant
           shall stand fast with him.

19:089:029 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne
           as the days of heaven.

19:089:030 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

19:089:031 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

19:089:032 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
           iniquity with stripes.

19:089:033 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from
           him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

19:089:034 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
           out of my lips.

19:089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto
           David.

19:089:036 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun
           before me.

19:089:037 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a
           faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

19:089:038 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
           thine anointed.

19:089:039 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
           profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

19:089:040 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
           strong holds to ruin.

19:089:041 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
           neighbours.

19:089:042 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
           made all his enemies to rejoice.

19:089:043 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
           him to stand in the battle.

19:089:044 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
           the ground.

19:089:045 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered
           him with shame. Selah.

19:089:046 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy
           wrath burn like fire?

19:089:047 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all
           men in vain?

19:089:048 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
           deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

19:089:049 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou
           swarest unto David in thy truth?

19:089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
           my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

19:089:051 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith
           they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

19:089:052 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

19:090:001 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

19:090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
           formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
           everlasting, thou art God.

19:090:003 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye
           children of men.

19:090:004 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it
           is past, and as a watch in the night.

19:090:005 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
           in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.

19:090:006 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening
           it is cut down, and withereth.

19:090:007 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
           troubled.

19:090:008 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in
           the light of thy countenance.

19:090:009 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our
           years as a tale that is told.

19:090:010 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
           reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their
           strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly
           away.

19:090:011 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
           fear, so is thy wrath.

19:090:012 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
           unto wisdom.

19:090:013 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning
           thy servants.

19:090:014 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be
           glad all our days.

19:090:015 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
           us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.

19:090:016 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto
           their children.

19:090:017 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and
           establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of
           our hands establish thou it.

19:091:001 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall
           abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

19:091:002 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
           God; in him will I trust.

19:091:003 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
           from the noisome pestilence.

19:091:004 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings
           shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

19:091:005 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
           arrow that flieth by day;

19:091:006 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
           destruction that wasteth at noonday.

19:091:007 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
           right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

19:091:008 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of
           the wicked.

19:091:009 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
           most High, thy habitation;

19:091:010 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
           nigh thy dwelling.

19:091:011 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
           all thy ways.

19:091:012 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy
           foot against a stone.

19:091:013 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and
           the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

19:091:014 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
           him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

19:091:015 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with
           him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

19:091:016 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

19:092:001 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING
           PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:

19:092:002 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
           faithfulness every night,

19:092:003 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
           the harp with a solemn sound.

19:092:004 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
           triumph in the works of thy hands.

19:092:005 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very
           deep.

19:092:006 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand
           this.

19:092:007 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers
           of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed
           for ever:

19:092:008 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.

19:092:009 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
           perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

19:092:010 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I
           shall be anointed with fresh oil.

19:092:011 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine
           ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against
           me.

19:092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow
           like a cedar in Lebanon.

19:092:013 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish
           in the courts of our God.

19:092:014 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be
           fat and flourishing;

19:092:015 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is
           no unrighteousness in him.

19:093:001 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
           clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the
           world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

19:093:002 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.

19:093:003 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
           their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

19:093:004 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters,
           yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.

19:093:005 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house,
           O LORD, for ever.

19:094:001 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom
           vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.

19:094:002 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to
           the proud.

19:094:003 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
           triumph?

19:094:004 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
           workers of iniquity boast themselves?

19:094:005 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
           heritage.

19:094:006 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the
           fatherless.

19:094:007 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
           Jacob regard it.

19:094:008 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when
           will ye be wise?

19:094:009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the
           eye, shall he not see?

19:094:010 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
           teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?

19:094:011 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

19:094:012 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
           him out of thy law;

19:094:013 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
           until the pit be digged for the wicked.

19:094:014 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
           forsake his inheritance.

19:094:015 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
           upright in heart shall follow it.

19:094:016 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will
           stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

19:094:017 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
           silence.

19:094:018 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.

19:094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
           my soul.

19:094:020 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
           frameth mischief by a law?

19:094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the
           righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

19:094:022 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my
           refuge.

19:094:023 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut
           them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall
           cut them off.

19:095:001 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise
           to the rock of our salvation.

19:095:002 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
           joyful noise unto him with psalms.

19:095:003 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

19:095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of
           the hills is his also.

19:095:005 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
           land.

19:095:006 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the
           LORD our maker.

19:095:007 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and
           the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

19:095:008 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the
           day of temptation in the wilderness:

19:095:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

19:095:010 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
           It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not
           known my ways:

19:095:011 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into
           my rest.

19:096:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the
           earth.

19:096:002 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation
           from day to day.

19:096:003 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all
           people.

19:096:004 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be
           feared above all gods.

19:096:005 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made
           the heavens.

19:096:006 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in
           his sanctuary.

19:096:007 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
           LORD glory and strength.

19:096:008 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
           offering, and come into his courts.

19:096:009 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,
           all the earth.

19:096:010 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also
           shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall
           judge the people righteously.

19:096:011 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the
           sea roar, and the fulness thereof.

19:096:012 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall
           all the trees of the wood rejoice

19:096:013 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
           earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the
           people with his truth.

19:097:001 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
           isles be glad thereof.

19:097:002 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
           judgment are the habitation of his throne.

19:097:003 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round
           about.

19:097:004 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and
           trembled.

19:097:005 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
           presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

19:097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see
           his glory.

19:097:007 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
           themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.

19:097:008 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
           because of thy judgments, O LORD.

19:097:009 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
           far above all gods.

19:097:010 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of
           his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

19:097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright
           in heart.

19:097:012 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
           remembrance of his holiness.

19:098:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
           things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the
           victory.

19:098:002 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath
           he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

19:098:003 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
           Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of
           our God.

19:098:004 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
           noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

19:098:005 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice
           of a psalm.

19:098:006 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before
           the LORD, the King.

19:098:007 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
           that dwell therein.

19:098:008 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful
           together

19:098:009 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with
           righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with
           equity.

19:099:001 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between
           the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

19:099:002 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the
           people.

19:099:003 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

19:099:004 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
           equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

19:099:005 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for
           he is holy.

19:099:006 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
           call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered
           them.

19:099:007 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
           testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

19:099:008 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that
           forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their
           inventions.

19:099:009 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
           LORD our God is holy.

19:100:001 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

19:100:002 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
           singing.

19:100:003 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us,
           and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his
           pasture.

19:100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts
           with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

19:100:005 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
           endureth to all generations.

19:101:001 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
           sing.

19:101:002 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
           come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect
           heart.

19:101:003 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work
           of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

19:101:004 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
           person.

19:101:005 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off:
           him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I
           suffer.

19:101:006 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they
           may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall
           serve me.

19:101:007 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he
           that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

19:101:008 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may
           cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

19:102:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

19:102:002 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
           incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me
           speedily.

19:102:003 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned
           as an hearth.

19:102:004 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
           to eat my bread.

19:102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
           skin.

19:102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
           desert.

19:102:007 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

19:102:008 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
           against me are sworn against me.

19:102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
           weeping.

19:102:010 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
           lifted me up, and cast me down.

19:102:011 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
           like grass.

19:102:012 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
           unto all generations.

19:102:013 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
           favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

19:102:014 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
           dust thereof.

19:102:015 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
           kings of the earth thy glory.

19:102:016 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
           glory.

19:102:017 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
           their prayer.

19:102:018 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
           people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

19:102:019 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
           heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

19:102:020 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
           appointed to death;

19:102:021 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
           Jerusalem;

19:102:022 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
           serve the LORD.

19:102:023 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

19:102:024 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
           thy years are throughout all generations.

19:102:025 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
           heavens are the work of thy hands.

19:102:026 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
           shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
           them, and they shall be changed:

19:102:027 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

19:102:028 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
           shall be established before thee.

19:103:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless
           his holy name.

19:103:002 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

19:103:003 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
           diseases;

19:103:004 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee
           with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

19:103:005 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth
           is renewed like the eagle's.

19:103:006 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
           oppressed.

19:103:007 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children
           of Israel.

19:103:008 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and
           plenteous in mercy.

19:103:009 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
           ever.

19:103:010 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
           according to our iniquities.

19:103:011 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
           mercy toward them that fear him.

19:103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed
           our transgressions from us.

19:103:013 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth
           them that fear him.

19:103:014 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

19:103:015 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field,
           so he flourisheth.

19:103:016 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
           thereof shall know it no more.

19:103:017 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
           upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's
           children;

19:103:018 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
           commandments to do them.

19:103:019 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
           kingdom ruleth over all.

19:103:020 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
           his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

19:103:021 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
           do his pleasure.

19:103:022 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
           bless the LORD, O my soul.

19:104:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
           thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

19:104:002 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
           stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

19:104:003 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
           the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the
           wind:

19:104:004 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

19:104:005 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
           removed for ever.

19:104:006 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
           stood above the mountains.

19:104:007 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they
           hasted away.

19:104:008 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
           the place which thou hast founded for them.

19:104:009 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
           turn not again to cover the earth.

19:104:010 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
           hills.

19:104:011 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
           quench their thirst.

19:104:012 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
           which sing among the branches.

19:104:013 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is
           satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

19:104:014 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
           service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

19:104:015 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make
           his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.

19:104:016 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
           which he hath planted;

19:104:017 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
           trees are her house.

19:104:018 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
           for the conies.

19:104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
           down.

19:104:020 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
           of the forest do creep forth.

19:104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat
           from God.

19:104:022 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
           down in their dens.

19:104:023 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
           evening.

19:104:024 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
           them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

19:104:025 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
           innumerable, both small and great beasts.

19:104:026 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
           made to play therein.

19:104:027 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their
           meat in due season.

19:104:028 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
           they are filled with good.

19:104:029 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away
           their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

19:104:030 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
           renewest the face of the earth.

19:104:031 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
           rejoice in his works.

19:104:032 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
           hills, and they smoke.

19:104:033 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing
           praise to my God while I have my being.

19:104:034 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
           LORD.

19:104:035 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
           wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye
           the LORD.

19:105:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known
           his deeds among the people.

19:105:002 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his
           wondrous works.

19:105:003 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
           seek the LORD.

19:105:004 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

19:105:005 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
           and the judgments of his mouth;

19:105:006 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
           chosen.

19:105:007 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.

19:105:008 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
           commanded to a thousand generations.

19:105:009 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

19:105:010 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
           an everlasting covenant:

19:105:011 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
           your inheritance:

19:105:012 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
           strangers in it.

19:105:013 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
           another people;

19:105:014 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
           for their sakes;

19:105:015 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

19:105:016 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
           whole staff of bread.

19:105:017 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
           servant:

19:105:018 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

19:105:019 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
           him.

19:105:020 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people,
           and let him go free.

19:105:021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

19:105:022 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
           wisdom.

19:105:023 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land
           of Ham.

19:105:024 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
           than their enemies.

19:105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly
           with his servants.

19:105:026 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

19:105:027 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
           Ham.

19:105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
           against his word.

19:105:029 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

19:105:030 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers
           of their kings.

19:105:031 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in
           all their coasts.

19:105:032 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

19:105:033 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
           trees of their coasts.

19:105:034 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
           without number,

19:105:035 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
           fruit of their ground.

19:105:036 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of
           all their strength.

19:105:037 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
           not one feeble person among their tribes.

19:105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
           upon them.

19:105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in
           the night.

19:105:040 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
           with the bread of heaven.

19:105:041 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
           dry places like a river.

19:105:042 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

19:105:043 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
           gladness:

19:105:044 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
           labour of the people;

19:105:045 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.
           Praise ye the LORD.

19:106:001 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is
           good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

19:106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
           all his praise?

19:106:003 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
           righteousness at all times.

19:106:004 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto
           thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

19:106:005 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in
           the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine
           inheritance.

19:106:006 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,
           we have done wickedly.

19:106:007 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
           remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him
           at the sea, even at the Red sea.

19:106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
           make his mighty power to be known.

19:106:009 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led
           them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

19:106:010 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
           redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

19:106:011 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of
           them left.

19:106:012 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

19:106:013 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

19:106:014 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
           the desert.

19:106:015 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
           soul.

19:106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
           LORD.

19:106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
           company of Abiram.

19:106:018 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
           the wicked.

19:106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

19:106:020 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
           that eateth grass.

19:106:021 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
           Egypt;

19:106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
           Red sea.

19:106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
           his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his
           wrath, lest he should destroy them.

19:106:024 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
           word:

19:106:025 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
           of the LORD.

19:106:026 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow
           them in the wilderness:

19:106:027 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
           them in the lands.

19:106:028 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
           sacrifices of the dead.

19:106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
           plague brake in upon them.

19:106:030 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
           plague was stayed.

19:106:031 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
           generations for evermore.

19:106:032 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
           ill with Moses for their sakes:

19:106:033 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
           with his lips.

19:106:034 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
           commanded them:

19:106:035 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

19:106:036 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

19:106:037 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
           devils,

19:106:038 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
           their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of
           Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

19:106:039 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a
           whoring with their own inventions.

19:106:040 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his
           people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

19:106:041 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
           hated them ruled over them.

19:106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
           subjection under their hand.

19:106:043 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
           their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

19:106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
           cry:

19:106:045 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented
           according to the multitude of his mercies.

19:106:046 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
           captives.

19:106:047 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
           to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy
           praise.

19:106:048 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
           everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the
           LORD.

19:107:001 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:107:002 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed
           from the hand of the enemy;

19:107:003 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
           the west, from the north, and from the south.

19:107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found
           no city to dwell in.

19:107:005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

19:107:006 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he
           delivered them out of their distresses.

19:107:007 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to
           a city of habitation.

19:107:008 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:009 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry
           soul with goodness.

19:107:010 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being
           bound in affliction and iron;

19:107:011 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
           the counsel of the most High:

19:107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
           down, and there was none to help.

19:107:013 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
           them out of their distresses.

19:107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
           brake their bands in sunder.

19:107:015 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:016 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of
           iron in sunder.

19:107:017 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
           iniquities, are afflicted.

19:107:018 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
           unto the gates of death.

19:107:019 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
           them out of their distresses.

19:107:020 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
           their destructions.

19:107:021 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:022 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
           declare his works with rejoicing.

19:107:023 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
           great waters;

19:107:024 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

19:107:025 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
           up the waves thereof.

19:107:026 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
           their soul is melted because of trouble.

19:107:027 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
           at their wit's end.

19:107:028 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
           them out of their distresses.

19:107:029 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
           still.

19:107:030 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
           unto their desired haven.

19:107:031 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
           his wonderful works to the children of men!

19:107:032 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
           praise him in the assembly of the elders.

19:107:033 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
           dry ground;

19:107:034 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
           that dwell therein.

19:107:035 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry
           ground into watersprings.

19:107:036 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
           a city for habitation;

19:107:037 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield
           fruits of increase.

19:107:038 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
           and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

19:107:039 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
           affliction, and sorrow.

19:107:040 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander
           in the wilderness, where there is no way.

19:107:041 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh
           him families like a flock.

19:107:042 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity
           shall stop her mouth.

19:107:043 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
           understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.

19:108:001 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even
           with my glory.

19:108:002 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

19:108:003 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
           praises unto thee among the nations.

19:108:004 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth
           reacheth unto the clouds.

19:108:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
           all the earth;

19:108:006 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand,
           and answer me.

19:108:007 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
           Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

19:108:008 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
           of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

19:108:009 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
           Philistia will I triumph.

19:108:010 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
           Edom?

19:108:011 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
           O God, go forth with our hosts?

19:108:012 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

19:108:013 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
           tread down our enemies.

19:109:001 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

19:109:002 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
           opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying
           tongue.

19:109:003 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
           against me without a cause.

19:109:004 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
           prayer.

19:109:005 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my
           love.

19:109:006 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his
           right hand.

19:109:007 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
           prayer become sin.

19:109:008 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

19:109:009 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

19:109:010 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
           seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

19:109:011 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
           strangers spoil his labour.

19:109:012 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there
           be any to favour his fatherless children.

19:109:013 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
           let their name be blotted out.

19:109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
           and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

19:109:015 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
           the memory of them from the earth.

19:109:016 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
           the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in
           heart.

19:109:017 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
           not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

19:109:018 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
           so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into
           his bones.

19:109:019 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for
           a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

19:109:020 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
           of them that speak evil against my soul.

19:109:021 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
           because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

19:109:022 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

19:109:023 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up
           and down as the locust.

19:109:024 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
           fatness.

19:109:025 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
           they shaked their heads.

19:109:026 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

19:109:027 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD,
           hast done it.

19:109:028 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
           ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

19:109:029 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
           themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

19:109:030 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
           praise him among the multitude.

19:109:031 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
           from those that condemn his soul.

19:110:001 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
           make thine enemies thy footstool.

19:110:002 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule
           thou in the midst of thine enemies.

19:110:003 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
           beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast
           the dew of thy youth.

19:110:004 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest
           for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

19:110:005 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the
           day of his wrath.

19:110:006 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places
           with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many
           countries.

19:110:007 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he
           lift up the head.

19:111:001 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole
           heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the
           congregation.

19:111:002 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
           have pleasure therein.

19:111:003 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness
           endureth for ever.

19:111:004 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
           gracious and full of compassion.

19:111:005 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
           mindful of his covenant.

19:111:006 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
           give them the heritage of the heathen.

19:111:007 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
           commandments are sure.

19:111:008 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
           uprightness.

19:111:009 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
           covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

19:111:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
           understanding have all they that do his commandments: his
           praise endureth for ever.

19:112:001 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
           that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

19:112:002 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
           upright shall be blessed.

19:112:003 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
           endureth for ever.

19:112:004 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
           gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

19:112:005 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his
           affairs with discretion.

19:112:006 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be
           in everlasting remembrance.

19:112:007 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
           trusting in the LORD.

19:112:008 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
           his desire upon his enemies.

19:112:009 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his
           righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted
           with honour.

19:112:010 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
           his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall
           perish.

19:113:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
           the name of the LORD.

19:113:002 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
           evermore.

19:113:003 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
           LORD's name is to be praised.

19:113:004 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
           heavens.

19:113:005 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

19:113:006 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
           and in the earth!

19:113:007 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
           out of the dunghill;

19:113:008 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
           people.

19:113:009 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
           mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.

19:114:001 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a
           people of strange language;

19:114:002 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

19:114:003 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

19:114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
           lambs.

19:114:005 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
           that thou wast driven back?

19:114:006 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
           like lambs?

19:114:007 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
           presence of the God of Jacob;

19:114:008 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
           fountain of waters.

19:115:001 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give
           glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

19:115:002 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?

19:115:003 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
           pleased.

19:115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

19:115:005 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they
           see not:

19:115:006 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
           smell not:

19:115:007 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
           walk not: neither speak they through their throat.

19:115:008 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
           trusteth in them.

19:115:009 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their
           shield.

19:115:010 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
           their shield.

19:115:011 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
           their shield.

19:115:012 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will
           bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.

19:115:013 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

19:115:014 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
           children.

19:115:015 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.

19:115:016 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth
           hath he given to the children of men.

19:115:017 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
           silence.

19:115:018 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
           evermore. Praise the LORD.

19:116:001 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
           supplications.

19:116:002 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I
           call upon him as long as I live.

19:116:003 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
           hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

19:116:004 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech
           thee, deliver my soul.

19:116:005 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.

19:116:006 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he
           helped me.

19:116:007 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
           bountifully with thee.

19:116:008 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
           tears, and my feet from falling.

19:116:009 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

19:116:010 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

19:116:011 I said in my haste, All men are liars.

19:116:012 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
           me?

19:116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of
           the LORD.

19:116:014 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
           his people.

19:116:015 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.

19:116:016 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
           of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

19:116:017 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
           call upon the name of the LORD.

19:116:018 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
           his people.

19:116:019 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O
           Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

19:117:001 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.

19:117:002 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of
           the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.

19:118:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:118:002 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

19:118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
           ever.

19:118:004 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:118:005 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and
           set me in a large place.

19:118:006 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto
           me?

19:118:007 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore
           shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.

19:118:008 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
           man.

19:118:009 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
           princes.

19:118:010 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD
           will I destroy them.

19:118:011 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in
           the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

19:118:012 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the
           fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy
           them.

19:118:013 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD
           helped me.

19:118:014 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

19:118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
           the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

19:118:016 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
           LORD doeth valiantly.

19:118:017 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

19:118:018 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
           unto death.

19:118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them,
           and I will praise the LORD:

19:118:020 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

19:118:021 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
           salvation.

19:118:022 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
           of the corner.

19:118:023 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.

19:118:024 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
           be glad in it.

19:118:025 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send
           now prosperity.

19:118:026 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have
           blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

19:118:027 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the
           sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

19:118:028 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I
           will exalt thee.

19:118:029 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:119:001 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of
           the LORD.

19:119:002 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
           with the whole heart.

19:119:003 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.

19:119:004 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.

19:119:005 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!

19:119:006 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
           commandments.

19:119:007 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall
           have learned thy righteous judgments.

19:119:008 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.

19:119:009 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
           thereto according to thy word.

19:119:010 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
           from thy commandments.

19:119:011 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin
           against thee.

19:119:012 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.

19:119:013 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.

19:119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
           all riches.

19:119:015 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
           ways.

19:119:016 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
           word.

19:119:017 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
           thy word.

19:119:018 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
           thy law.

19:119:019 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from
           me.

19:119:020 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
           judgments at all times.

19:119:021 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
           thy commandments.

19:119:022 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
           testimonies.

19:119:023 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
           meditate in thy statutes.

19:119:024 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.

19:119:025 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to
           thy word.

19:119:026 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
           statutes.

19:119:027 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk
           of thy wondrous works.

19:119:028 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
           unto thy word.

19:119:029 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
           graciously.

19:119:030 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
           before me.

19:119:031 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to
           shame.

19:119:032 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt
           enlarge my heart.

19:119:033 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
           unto the end.

19:119:034 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
           observe it with my whole heart.

19:119:035 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do
           I delight.

19:119:036 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to
           covetousness.

19:119:037 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
           in thy way.

19:119:038 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy
           fear.

19:119:039 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are
           good.

19:119:040 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
           righteousness.

19:119:041 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
           according to thy word.

19:119:042 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
           for I trust in thy word.

19:119:043 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
           have hoped in thy judgments.

19:119:044 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.

19:119:045 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.

19:119:046 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will
           not be ashamed.

19:119:047 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
           loved.

19:119:048 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
           have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

19:119:049 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast
           caused me to hope.

19:119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
           quickened me.

19:119:051 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not
           declined from thy law.

19:119:052 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
           myself.

19:119:053 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
           forsake thy law.

19:119:054 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.

19:119:055 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have
           kept thy law.

19:119:056 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.

19:119:057 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
           words.

19:119:058 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto
           me according to thy word.

19:119:059 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

19:119:060 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

19:119:061 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
           forgotten thy law.

19:119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of
           thy righteous judgments.

19:119:063 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
           keep thy precepts.

19:119:064 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy
           statutes.

19:119:065 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
           thy word.

19:119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
           commandments.

19:119:067 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
           word.

19:119:068 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

19:119:069 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
           precepts with my whole heart.

19:119:070 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.

19:119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
           learn thy statutes.

19:119:072 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
           and silver.

19:119:073 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me
           understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

19:119:074 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
           have hoped in thy word.

19:119:075 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
           faithfulness hast afflicted me.

19:119:076 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
           according to thy word unto thy servant.

19:119:077 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
           law is my delight.

19:119:078 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
           without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.

19:119:079 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
           known thy testimonies.

19:119:080 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.

19:119:081 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.

19:119:082 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort
           me?

19:119:083 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not
           forget thy statutes.

19:119:084 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
           judgment on them that persecute me?

19:119:085 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy
           law.

19:119:086 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
           wrongfully; help thou me.

19:119:087 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
           precepts.

19:119:088 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
           testimony of thy mouth.

19:119:089 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

19:119:090 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast
           established the earth, and it abideth.

19:119:091 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
           are thy servants.

19:119:092 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
           perished in mine affliction.

19:119:093 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
           quickened me.

19:119:094 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.

19:119:095 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
           consider thy testimonies.

19:119:096 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
           exceeding broad.

19:119:097 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.

19:119:098 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
           enemies: for they are ever with me.

19:119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
           testimonies are my meditation.

19:119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
           precepts.

19:119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
           keep thy word.

19:119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
           me.

19:119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
           to my mouth!

19:119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
           every false way.

19:119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

19:119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
           righteous judgments.

19:119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
           thy word.

19:119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
           LORD, and teach me thy judgments.

19:119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
           law.

19:119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
           precepts.

19:119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they
           are the rejoicing of my heart.

19:119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
           unto the end.

19:119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.

19:119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.

19:119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments
           of my God.

19:119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me
           not be ashamed of my hope.

19:119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect
           unto thy statutes continually.

19:119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
           for their deceit is falsehood.

19:119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
           therefore I love thy testimonies.

19:119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
           judgments.

19:119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
           oppressors.

19:119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
           me.

19:119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
           righteousness.

19:119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
           thy statutes.

19:119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
           testimonies.

19:119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
           thy law.

19:119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
           gold.

19:119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
           be right; and I hate every false way.

19:119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
           them.

19:119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
           understanding unto the simple.

19:119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
           commandments.

19:119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
           do unto those that love thy name.

19:119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
           dominion over me.

19:119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
           precepts.

19:119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
           statutes.

19:119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
           law.

19:119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.

19:119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
           very faithful.

19:119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
           thy words.

19:119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.

19:119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.

19:119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
           is the truth.

19:119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy
           commandments are my delights.

19:119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
           understanding, and I shall live.

19:119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
           statutes.

19:119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.

19:119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
           thy word.

19:119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
           thy word.

19:119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,
           quicken me according to thy judgment.

19:119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from
           thy law.

19:119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.

19:119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
           founded them for ever.

19:119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget
           thy law.

19:119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy
           word.

19:119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
           statutes.

19:119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to
           thy judgments.

19:119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
           from thy testimonies.

19:119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
           not thy word.

19:119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,
           according to thy lovingkindness.

19:119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
           righteous judgments endureth for ever.

19:119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart
           standeth in awe of thy word.

19:119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.

19:119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.

19:119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
           judgments.

19:119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
           offend them.

19:119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
           commandments.

19:119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
           exceedingly.

19:119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways
           are before thee.

19:119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
           understanding according to thy word.

19:119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to
           thy word.

19:119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
           statutes.

19:119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments
           are righteousness.

19:119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.

19:119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
           delight.

19:119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
           judgments help me.

19:119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
           do not forget thy commandments.

19:120:001 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.

19:120:002 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
           tongue.

19:120:003 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto
           thee, thou false tongue?

19:120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

19:120:005 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
           of Kedar!

19:120:006 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.

19:120:007 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.

19:121:001 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
           help.

19:121:002 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.

19:121:003 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee
           will not slumber.

19:121:004 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor
           sleep.

19:121:005 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
           hand.

19:121:006 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

19:121:007 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve
           thy soul.

19:121:008 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
           this time forth, and even for evermore.

19:122:001 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
           the LORD.

19:122:002 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

19:122:003 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

19:122:004 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
           testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

19:122:005 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the
           house of David.

19:122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
           thee.

19:122:007 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

19:122:008 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace
           be within thee.

19:122:009 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.

19:123:001 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
           heavens.

19:123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
           masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
           mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that
           he have mercy upon us.

19:123:003 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
           exceedingly filled with contempt.

19:123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
           are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

19:124:001 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may
           Israel say;

19:124:002 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
           up against us:

19:124:003 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
           kindled against us:

19:124:004 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over
           our soul:

19:124:005 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

19:124:006 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
           teeth.

19:124:007 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
           the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

19:124:008 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and
           earth.

19:125:001 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which
           cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.

19:125:002 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is
           round about his people from henceforth even for ever.

19:125:003 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
           righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto
           iniquity.

19:125:004 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
           upright in their hearts.

19:125:005 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
           shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace
           shall be upon Israel.

19:126:001 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
           them that dream.

19:126:002 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
           singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done
           great things for them.

19:126:003 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

19:126:004 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

19:126:005 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

19:126:006 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
           doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
           him.

19:127:001 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that
           build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh
           but in vain.

19:127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat
           the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

19:127:003 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
           womb is his reward.

19:127:004 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
           the youth.

19:127:005 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
           not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the
           gate.

19:128:001 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in
           his ways.

19:128:002 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou
           be, and it shall be well with thee.

19:128:003 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
           house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

19:128:004 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
           LORD.

19:128:005 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the
           good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

19:128:006 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
           Israel.

19:129:001 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel
           now say:

19:129:002 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they
           have not prevailed against me.

19:129:003 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

19:129:004 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
           wicked.

19:129:005 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

19:129:006 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
           afore it groweth up:

19:129:007 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
           sheaves his bosom.

19:129:008 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
           upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

19:130:001 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

19:130:002 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice
           of my supplications.

19:130:003 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
           stand?

19:130:004 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
           feared.

19:130:005 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
           hope.

19:130:006 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
           morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

19:130:007 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,
           and with him is plenteous redemption.

19:130:008 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

19:131:001 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do
           I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for
           me.

19:131:002 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
           weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

19:131:003 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.

19:132:001 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:

19:132:002 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
           Jacob;

19:132:003 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go
           up into my bed;

19:132:004 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine
           eyelids,

19:132:005 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
           mighty God of Jacob.

19:132:006 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of
           the wood.

19:132:007 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his
           footstool.

19:132:008 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy
           strength.

19:132:009 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
           saints shout for joy.

19:132:010 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
           anointed.

19:132:011 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from
           it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

19:132:012 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I
           shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy
           throne for evermore.

19:132:013 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
           habitation.

19:132:014 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have
           desired it.

19:132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor
           with bread.

19:132:016 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints
           shall shout aloud for joy.

19:132:017 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a
           lamp for mine anointed.

19:132:018 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall
           his crown flourish.

19:133:001 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
           together in unity!

19:133:002 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
           upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the
           skirts of his garments;

19:133:003 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
           mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing,
           even life for evermore.

19:134:001 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which
           by night stand in the house of the LORD.

19:134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.

19:134:003 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.

19:135:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise
           him, O ye servants of the LORD.

19:135:002 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the
           house of our God.

19:135:003 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his
           name; for it is pleasant.

19:135:004 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for
           his peculiar treasure.

19:135:005 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above
           all gods.

19:135:006 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
           earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

19:135:007 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
           he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of
           his treasuries.

19:135:008 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

19:135:009 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
           upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

19:135:010 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

19:135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
           kingdoms of Canaan:

19:135:012 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel
           his people.

19:135:013 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD,
           throughout all generations.

19:135:014 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself
           concerning his servants.

19:135:015 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of
           men's hands.

19:135:016 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
           see not;

19:135:017 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath
           in their mouths.

19:135:018 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that
           trusteth in them.

19:135:019 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of
           Aaron:

19:135:020 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless
           the LORD.

19:135:021 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
           Praise ye the LORD.

19:136:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:136:002 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for
           ever.

19:136:003 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for
           ever.

19:136:004 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:005 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:006 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:007 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for
           ever:

19:136:008 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:010 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy
           endureth for ever:

19:136:011 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth
           for ever:

19:136:012 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:013 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy
           endureth for ever:

19:136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy
           endureth for ever:

19:136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:016 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his
           mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:017 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for
           ever:

19:136:018 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:020 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:

19:136:021 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth
           for ever:

19:136:022 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy
           endureth for ever.

19:136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth
           for ever:

19:136:024 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:136:025 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.

19:136:026 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth
           for ever.

19:137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
           when we remembered Zion.

19:137:002 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

19:137:003 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
           song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying,
           Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

19:137:004 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

19:137:005 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
           cunning.

19:137:006 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
           my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

19:137:007 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of
           Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation
           thereof.

19:137:008 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he
           be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

19:137:009 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
           against the stones.

19:138:001 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I
           sing praise unto thee.

19:138:002 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for
           thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified
           thy word above all thy name.

19:138:003 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst
           me with strength in my soul.

19:138:004 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when
           they hear the words of thy mouth.

19:138:005 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the
           glory of the LORD.

19:138:006 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly:
           but the proud he knoweth afar off.

19:138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me:
           thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine
           enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.

19:138:008 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O
           LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own
           hands.

19:139:001 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.

19:139:002 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
           understandest my thought afar off.

19:139:003 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
           with all my ways.

19:139:004 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou
           knowest it altogether.

19:139:005 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon
           me.

19:139:006 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
           attain unto it.

19:139:007 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee
           from thy presence?

19:139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed
           in hell, behold, thou art there.

19:139:009 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
           parts of the sea;

19:139:010 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
           hold me.

19:139:011 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night
           shall be light about me.

19:139:012 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth
           as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

19:139:013 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
           mother's womb.

19:139:014 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
           marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

19:139:015 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
           and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

19:139:016 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
           thy book all my members were written, which in continuance
           were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

19:139:017 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great
           is the sum of them!

19:139:018 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
           when I awake, I am still with thee.

19:139:019 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me
           therefore, ye bloody men.

19:139:020 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take
           thy name in vain.

19:139:021 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I
           grieved with those that rise up against thee?

19:139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

19:139:023 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
           thoughts:

19:139:024 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
           way everlasting.

19:140:001 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the
           violent man;

19:140:002 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they
           gathered together for war.

19:140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders'
           poison is under their lips. Selah.

19:140:004 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me
           from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my
           goings.

19:140:005 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread
           a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

19:140:006 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my
           supplications, O LORD.

19:140:007 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast
           covered my head in the day of battle.

19:140:008 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his
           wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

19:140:009 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the
           mischief of their own lips cover them.

19:140:010 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the
           fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

19:140:011 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil
           shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

19:140:012 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
           and the right of the poor.

19:140:013 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the
           upright shall dwell in thy presence.

19:141:001 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my
           voice, when I cry unto thee.

19:141:002 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the
           lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

19:141:003 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my
           lips.

19:141:004 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked
           works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their
           dainties.

19:141:005 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let
           him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not
           break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their
           calamities.

19:141:006 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall
           hear my words; for they are sweet.

19:141:007 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one
           cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.

19:141:008 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my
           trust; leave not my soul destitute.

19:141:009 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the
           gins of the workers of iniquity.

19:141:010 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal
           escape.

19:142:001 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the
           LORD did I make my supplication.

19:142:002 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
           trouble.

19:142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
           path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a
           snare for me.

19:142:004 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man
           that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my
           soul.

19:142:005 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my
           portion in the land of the living.

19:142:006 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from
           my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

19:142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the
           righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal
           bountifully with me.

19:143:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
           faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.

19:143:002 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight
           shall no man living be justified.

19:143:003 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
           down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as
           those that have been long dead.

19:143:004 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within
           me is desolate.

19:143:005 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I
           muse on the work of thy hands.

19:143:006 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after
           thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

19:143:007 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face
           from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

19:143:008 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in
           thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should
           walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.

19:143:009 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to
           hide me.

19:143:010 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is
           good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

19:143:011 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy
           righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

19:143:012 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them
           that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.

19:144:001 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to
           war, and my fingers to fight:

19:144:002 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;
           my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people
           under me.

19:144:003 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the
           son of man, that thou makest account of him!

19:144:004 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth
           away.

19:144:005 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains,
           and they shall smoke.

19:144:006 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine
           arrows, and destroy them.

19:144:007 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of
           great waters, from the hand of strange children;

19:144:008 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
           hand of falsehood.

19:144:009 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and
           an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

19:144:010 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth
           David his servant from the hurtful sword.

19:144:011 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children,
           whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
           hand of falsehood:

19:144:012 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that
           our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the
           similitude of a palace:

19:144:013 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store:
           that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in
           our streets:

19:144:014 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no
           breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in
           our streets.

19:144:015 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is
           that people, whose God is the LORD.

19:145:001 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name
           for ever and ever.

19:145:002 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for
           ever and ever.

19:145:003 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his
           greatness is unsearchable.

19:145:004 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall
           declare thy mighty acts.

19:145:005 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy
           wondrous works.

19:145:006 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I
           will declare thy greatness.

19:145:007 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
           and shall sing of thy righteousness.

19:145:008 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger,
           and of great mercy.

19:145:009 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all
           his works.

19:145:010 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall
           bless thee.

19:145:011 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
           power;

19:145:012 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
           glorious majesty of his kingdom.

19:145:013 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion
           endureth throughout all generations.

19:145:014 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those
           that be bowed down.

19:145:015 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their
           meat in due season.

19:145:016 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every
           living thing.

19:145:017 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
           works.

19:145:018 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
           call upon him in truth.

19:145:019 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
           hear their cry, and will save them.

19:145:020 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked
           will he destroy.

19:145:021 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh
           bless his holy name for ever and ever.

19:146:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

19:146:002 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto
           my God while I have any being.

19:146:003 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
           there is no help.

19:146:004 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
           very day his thoughts perish.

19:146:005 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose
           hope is in the LORD his God:

19:146:006 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein
           is: which keepeth truth for ever:

19:146:007 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food
           to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

19:146:008 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them
           that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:

19:146:009 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless
           and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

19:146:010 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
           generations. Praise ye the LORD.

19:147:001 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our
           God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

19:147:002 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the
           outcasts of Israel.

19:147:003 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

19:147:004 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by
           their names.

19:147:005 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
           infinite.

19:147:006 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to
           the ground.

19:147:007 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the
           harp unto our God:

19:147:008 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for
           the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

19:147:009 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
           cry.

19:147:010 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
           pleasure in the legs of a man.

19:147:011 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
           hope in his mercy.

19:147:012 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

19:147:013 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath
           blessed thy children within thee.

19:147:014 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
           finest of the wheat.

19:147:015 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
           very swiftly.

19:147:016 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like
           ashes.

19:147:017 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before
           his cold?

19:147:018 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
           to blow, and the waters flow.

19:147:019 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
           unto Israel.

19:147:020 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his
           judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.

19:148:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens:
           praise him in the heights.

19:148:002 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

19:148:003 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of
           light.

19:148:004 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above
           the heavens.

19:148:005 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and
           they were created.

19:148:006 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a
           decree which shall not pass.

19:148:007 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:

19:148:008 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
           word:

19:148:009 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

19:148:010 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

19:148:011 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
           the earth:

19:148:012 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

19:148:013 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
           excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

19:148:014 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
           saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto
           him. Praise ye the LORD.

19:149:001 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
           praise in the congregation of saints.

19:149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of
           Zion be joyful in their King.

19:149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises
           unto him with the timbrel and harp.

19:149:004 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify
           the meek with salvation.

19:149:005 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon
           their beds.

19:149:006 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
           sword in their hand;

19:149:007 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon
           the people;

19:149:008 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
           of iron;

19:149:009 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have
           all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.

19:150:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in
           the firmament of his power.

19:150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his
           excellent greatness.

19:150:003 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the
           psaltery and harp.

19:150:004 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with
           stringed instruments and organs.

19:150:005 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high
           sounding cymbals.

19:150:006 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye
           the LORD.

Book 20        Proverbs

20:001:001 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

20:001:002 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of
           understanding;

20:001:003 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment,
           and equity;

20:001:004 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
           discretion.

20:001:005 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
           understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:

20:001:006 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of
           the wise, and their dark sayings.

20:001:007 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools
           despise wisdom and instruction.

20:001:008 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not
           the law of thy mother:

20:001:009 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and
           chains about thy neck.

20:001:010 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

20:001:011 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us
           lurk privily for the innocent without cause:

20:001:012 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those
           that go down into the pit:

20:001:013 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses
           with spoil:

20:001:014 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:

20:001:015 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot
           from their path:

20:001:016 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

20:001:017 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

20:001:018 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for
           their own lives.

20:001:019 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which
           taketh away the life of the owners thereof.

20:001:020 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:

20:001:021 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of
           the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,

20:001:022 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the
           scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

20:001:023 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto
           you, I will make known my words unto you.

20:001:024 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
           hand, and no man regarded;

20:001:025 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
           reproof:

20:001:026 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear
           cometh;

20:001:027 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction
           cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon
           you.

20:001:028 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they
           shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:

20:001:029 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of
           the LORD:

20:001:030 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.

20:001:031 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be
           filled with their own devices.

20:001:032 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
           prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

20:001:033 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
           quiet from fear of evil.

20:002:001 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
           commandments with thee;

20:002:002 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine
           heart to understanding;

20:002:003 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice
           for understanding;

20:002:004 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for
           hid treasures;

20:002:005 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the
           knowledge of God.

20:002:006 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge
           and understanding.

20:002:007 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler
           to them that walk uprightly.

20:002:008 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of
           his saints.

20:002:009 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
           equity; yea, every good path.

20:002:010 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is
           pleasant unto thy soul;

20:002:011 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:

20:002:012 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man
           that speaketh froward things;

20:002:013 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of
           darkness;

20:002:014 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the
           wicked;

20:002:015 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:

20:002:016 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger
           which flattereth with her words;

20:002:017 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the
           covenant of her God.

20:002:018 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the
           dead.

20:002:019 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of
           the paths of life.

20:002:020 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the
           paths of the righteous.

20:002:021 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall
           remain in it.

20:002:022 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the
           transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

20:003:001 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
           commandments:

20:003:002 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add
           to thee.

20:003:003 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy
           neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:

20:003:004 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight
           of God and man.

20:003:005 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto
           thine own understanding.

20:003:006 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
           paths.

20:003:007 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from
           evil.

20:003:008 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

20:003:009 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits
           of all thine increase:

20:003:010 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses
           shall burst out with new wine.

20:003:011 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be
           weary of his correction:

20:003:012 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the
           son in whom he delighteth.

20:003:013 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
           understanding.

20:003:014 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
           silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

20:003:015 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou
           canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

20:003:016 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand
           riches and honour.

20:003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
           peace.

20:003:018 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and
           happy is every one that retaineth her.

20:003:019 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding
           hath he established the heavens.

20:003:020 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop
           down the dew.

20:003:021 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom
           and discretion:

20:003:022 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

20:003:023 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
           stumble.

20:003:024 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou
           shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

20:003:025 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
           wicked, when it cometh.

20:003:026 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot
           from being taken.

20:003:027 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in
           the power of thine hand to do it.

20:003:028 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow
           I will give; when thou hast it by thee.

20:003:029 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth
           securely by thee.

20:003:030 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
           harm.

20:003:031 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

20:003:032 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is
           with the righteous.

20:003:033 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he
           blesseth the habitation of the just.

20:003:034 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
           lowly.

20:003:035 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion
           of fools.

20:004:001 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to
           know understanding.

20:004:002 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

20:004:003 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the
           sight of my mother.

20:004:004 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my
           words: keep my commandments, and live.

20:004:005 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline
           from the words of my mouth.

20:004:006 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and
           she shall keep thee.

20:004:007 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with
           all thy getting get understanding.

20:004:008 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to
           honour, when thou dost embrace her.

20:004:009 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of
           glory shall she deliver to thee.

20:004:010 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy
           life shall be many.

20:004:011 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in
           right paths.

20:004:012 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when
           thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

20:004:013 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for
           she is thy life.

20:004:014 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way
           of evil men.

20:004:015 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

20:004:016 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their
           sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

20:004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of
           violence.

20:004:018 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
           more and more unto the perfect day.

20:004:019 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what
           they stumble.

20:004:020 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

20:004:021 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of
           thine heart.

20:004:022 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all
           their flesh.

20:004:023 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the
           issues of life.

20:004:024 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far
           from thee.

20:004:025 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look
           straight before thee.

20:004:026 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be
           established.

20:004:027 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot
           from evil.

20:005:001 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my
           understanding:

20:005:002 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep
           knowledge.

20:005:003 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her
           mouth is smoother than oil:

20:005:004 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

20:005:005 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

20:005:006 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are
           moveable, that thou canst not know them.

20:005:007 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the
           words of my mouth.

20:005:008 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her
           house:

20:005:009 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto
           the cruel:

20:005:010 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be
           in the house of a stranger;

20:005:011 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are
           consumed,

20:005:012 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised
           reproof;

20:005:013 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined
           mine ear to them that instructed me!

20:005:014 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and
           assembly.

20:005:015 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out
           of thine own well.

20:005:016 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in
           the streets.

20:005:017 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

20:005:018 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy
           youth.

20:005:019 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her
           breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always
           with her love.

20:005:020 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
           and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

20:005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he
           pondereth all his goings.

20:005:022 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall
           be holden with the cords of his sins.

20:005:023 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his
           folly he shall go astray.

20:006:001 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast
           stricken thy hand with a stranger,

20:006:002 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken
           with the words of thy mouth.

20:006:003 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come
           into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure
           thy friend.

20:006:004 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

20:006:005 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a
           bird from the hand of the fowler.

20:006:006 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

20:006:007 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

20:006:008 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in
           the harvest.

20:006:009 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out
           of thy sleep?

20:006:010 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
           hands to sleep:

20:006:011 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want
           as an armed man.

20:006:012 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

20:006:013 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he
           teacheth with his fingers;

20:006:014 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually;
           he soweth discord.

20:006:015 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he
           be broken without remedy.

20:006:016 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an
           abomination unto him:

20:006:017 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent
           blood,

20:006:018 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift
           in running to mischief,

20:006:019 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord
           among brethren.

20:006:020 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law
           of thy mother:

20:006:021 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy
           neck.

20:006:022 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it
           shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with
           thee.

20:006:023 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and
           reproofs of instruction are the way of life:

20:006:024 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the
           tongue of a strange woman.

20:006:025 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take
           thee with her eyelids.

20:006:026 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of
           bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.

20:006:027 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be
           burned?

20:006:028 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

20:006:029 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever
           toucheth her shall not be innocent.

20:006:030 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul
           when he is hungry;

20:006:031 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give
           all the substance of his house.

20:006:032 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh
           understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

20:006:033 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not
           be wiped away.

20:006:034 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare
           in the day of vengeance.

20:006:035 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,
           though thou givest many gifts.

20:007:001 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

20:007:002 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of
           thine eye.

20:007:003 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
           heart.

20:007:004 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding
           thy kinswoman:

20:007:005 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the
           stranger which flattereth with her words.

20:007:006 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

20:007:007 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the
           youths, a young man void of understanding,

20:007:008 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the
           way to her house,

20:007:009 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

20:007:010 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an
           harlot, and subtil of heart.

20:007:011 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

20:007:012 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at
           every corner.)

20:007:013 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face
           said unto him,

20:007:014 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

20:007:015 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy
           face, and I have found thee.

20:007:016 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
           works, with fine linen of Egypt.

20:007:017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

20:007:018 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
           solace ourselves with loves.

20:007:019 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:

20:007:020 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at
           the day appointed.

20:007:021 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
           flattering of her lips she forced him.

20:007:022 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the
           slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

20:007:023 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the
           snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.

20:007:024 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to
           the words of my mouth.

20:007:025 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her
           paths.

20:007:026 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have
           been slain by her.

20:007:027 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
           death.

20:008:001 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

20:008:002 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the
           places of the paths.

20:008:003 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the
           coming in at the doors.

20:008:004 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.

20:008:005 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an
           understanding heart.

20:008:006 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of
           my lips shall be right things.

20:008:007 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an
           abomination to my lips.

20:008:008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is
           nothing froward or perverse in them.

20:008:009 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to
           them that find knowledge.

20:008:010 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather
           than choice gold.

20:008:011 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may
           be desired are not to be compared to it.

20:008:012 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty
           inventions.

20:008:013 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy,
           and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

20:008:014 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have
           strength.

20:008:015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

20:008:016 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the
           earth.

20:008:017 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall
           find me.

20:008:018 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and
           righteousness.

20:008:019 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my
           revenue than choice silver.

20:008:020 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths
           of judgment:

20:008:021 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and
           I will fill their treasures.

20:008:022 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his
           works of old.

20:008:023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
           earth was.

20:008:024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there
           were no fountains abounding with water.

20:008:025 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
           brought forth:

20:008:026 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
           the highest part of the dust of the world.

20:008:027 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a
           compass upon the face of the depth:

20:008:028 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the
           fountains of the deep:

20:008:029 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not
           pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the
           earth:

20:008:030 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily
           his delight, rejoicing always before him;

20:008:031 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights
           were with the sons of men.

20:008:032 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are
           they that keep my ways.

20:008:033 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

20:008:034 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my
           gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

20:008:035 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of
           the LORD.

20:008:036 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they
           that hate me love death.

20:009:001 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven
           pillars:

20:009:002 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she
           hath also furnished her table.

20:009:003 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest
           places of the city,

20:009:004 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that
           wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

20:009:005 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have
           mingled.

20:009:006 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of
           understanding.

20:009:007 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he
           that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.

20:009:008 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man,
           and he will love thee.

20:009:009 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:
           teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.

20:009:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the
           knowledge of the holy is understanding.

20:009:011 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy
           life shall be increased.

20:009:012 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou
           scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.

20:009:013 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth
           nothing.

20:009:014 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the
           high places of the city,

20:009:015 To call passengers who go right on their ways:

20:009:016 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that
           wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

20:009:017 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is
           pleasant.

20:009:018 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her
           guests are in the depths of hell.

20:010:001 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but
           a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

20:010:002 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness
           delivereth from death.

20:010:003 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:
           but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.

20:010:004 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand
           of the diligent maketh rich.

20:010:005 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that
           sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.

20:010:006 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth
           the mouth of the wicked.

20:010:007 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked
           shall rot.

20:010:008 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating
           fool shall fall.

20:010:009 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that
           perverteth his ways shall be known.

20:010:010 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating
           fool shall fall.

20:010:011 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence
           covereth the mouth of the wicked.

20:010:012 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.

20:010:013 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
           but a rod is for the back of him that is void of
           understanding.

20:010:014 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is
           near destruction.

20:010:015 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of
           the poor is their poverty.

20:010:016 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the
           wicked to sin.

20:010:017 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
           refuseth reproof erreth.

20:010:018 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a
           slander, is a fool.

20:010:019 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that
           refraineth his lips is wise.

20:010:020 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the
           wicked is little worth.

20:010:021 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of
           wisdom.

20:010:022 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
           sorrow with it.

20:010:023 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
           understanding hath wisdom.

20:010:024 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire
           of the righteous shall be granted.

20:010:025 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the
           righteous is an everlasting foundation.

20:010:026 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the
           sluggard to them that send him.

20:010:027 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the
           wicked shall be shortened.

20:010:028 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the
           expectation of the wicked shall perish.

20:010:029 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but
           destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.

20:010:030 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not
           inhabit the earth.

20:010:031 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward
           tongue shall be cut out.

20:010:032 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the
           mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.

20:011:001 A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight
           is his delight.

20:011:002 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is
           wisdom.

20:011:003 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the
           perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

20:011:004 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness
           delivereth from death.

20:011:005 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the
           wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

20:011:006 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but
           transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.

20:011:007 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the
           hope of unjust men perisheth.

20:011:008 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked
           cometh in his stead.

20:011:009 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but
           through knowledge shall the just be delivered.

20:011:010 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and
           when the wicked perish, there is shouting.

20:011:011 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is
           overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

20:011:012 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man
           of understanding holdeth his peace.

20:011:013 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful
           spirit concealeth the matter.

20:011:014 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of
           counsellors there is safety.

20:011:015 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he
           that hateth suretiship is sure.

20:011:016 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain
           riches.

20:011:017 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is
           cruel troubleth his own flesh.

20:011:018 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth
           righteousness shall be a sure reward.

20:011:019 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil
           pursueth it to his own death.

20:011:020 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:
           but such as are upright in their way are his delight.

20:011:021 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:
           but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

20:011:022 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman
           which is without discretion.

20:011:023 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation
           of the wicked is wrath.

20:011:024 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is
           that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.

20:011:025 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall
           be watered also himself.

20:011:026 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but
           blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.

20:011:027 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that
           seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

20:011:028 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous
           shall flourish as a branch.

20:011:029 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and
           the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.

20:011:030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that
           winneth souls is wise.

20:011:031 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much
           more the wicked and the sinner.

20:012:001 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth
           reproof is brutish.

20:012:002 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked
           devices will he condemn.

20:012:003 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of
           the righteous shall not be moved.

20:012:004 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that
           maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.

20:012:005 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of
           the wicked are deceit.

20:012:006 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the
           mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

20:012:007 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the
           righteous shall stand.

20:012:008 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that
           is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

20:012:009 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he
           that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

20:012:010 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the
           tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

20:012:011 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he
           that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.

20:012:012 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the
           righteous yieldeth fruit.

20:012:013 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the
           just shall come out of trouble.

20:012:014 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:
           and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto
           him.

20:012:015 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that
           hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.

20:012:016 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth
           shame.

20:012:017 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a
           false witness deceit.

20:012:018 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the
           tongue of the wise is health.

20:012:019 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying
           tongue is but for a moment.

20:012:020 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the
           counsellors of peace is joy.

20:012:021 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall
           be filled with mischief.

20:012:022 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal
           truly are his delight.

20:012:023 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools
           proclaimeth foolishness.

20:012:024 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful
           shall be under tribute.

20:012:025 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word
           maketh it glad.

20:012:026 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the
           way of the wicked seduceth them.

20:012:027 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
           but the substance of a diligent man is precious.

20:012:028 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway
           thereof there is no death.

20:013:001 A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner
           heareth not rebuke.

20:013:002 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul
           of the transgressors shall eat violence.

20:013:003 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that
           openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.

20:013:004 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the
           soul of the diligent shall be made fat.

20:013:005 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome,
           and cometh to shame.

20:013:006 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but
           wickedness overthroweth the sinner.

20:013:007 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is
           that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.

20:013:008 The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor
           heareth not rebuke.

20:013:009 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the
           wicked shall be put out.

20:013:010 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is
           wisdom.

20:013:011 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that
           gathereth by labour shall increase.

20:013:012 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire
           cometh, it is a tree of life.

20:013:013 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that
           feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.

20:013:014 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the
           snares of death.

20:013:015 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors
           is hard.

20:013:016 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth
           open his folly.

20:013:017 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful
           ambassador is health.

20:013:018 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction:
           but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.

20:013:019 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is
           abomination to fools to depart from evil.

20:013:020 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion
           of fools shall be destroyed.

20:013:021 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be
           repayed.

20:013:022 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:
           and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.

20:013:023 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is
           destroyed for want of judgment.

20:013:024 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him
           chasteneth him betimes.

20:013:025 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the
           belly of the wicked shall want.

20:014:001 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh
           it down with her hands.

20:014:002 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he
           that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.

20:014:003 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of
           the wise shall preserve them.

20:014:004 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by
           the strength of the ox.

20:014:005 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will
           utter lies.

20:014:006 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is
           easy unto him that understandeth.

20:014:007 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest
           not in him the lips of knowledge.

20:014:008 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the
           folly of fools is deceit.

20:014:009 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is
           favour.

20:014:010 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not
           intermeddle with his joy.

20:014:011 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the
           tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.

20:014:012 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end
           thereof are the ways of death.

20:014:013 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that
           mirth is heaviness.

20:014:014 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and
           a good man shall be satisfied from himself.

20:014:015 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh
           well to his going.

20:014:016 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool
           rageth, and is confident.

20:014:017 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked
           devices is hated.

20:014:018 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with
           knowledge.

20:014:019 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of
           the righteous.

20:014:020 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath
           many friends.

20:014:021 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath
           mercy on the poor, happy is he.

20:014:022 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be
           to them that devise good.

20:014:023 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips
           tendeth only to penury.

20:014:024 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of
           fools is folly.

20:014:025 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness
           speaketh lies.

20:014:026 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children
           shall have a place of refuge.

20:014:027 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the
           snares of death.

20:014:028 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the
           want of people is the destruction of the prince.

20:014:029 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he
           that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

20:014:030 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the
           rottenness of the bones.

20:014:031 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that
           honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

20:014:032 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous
           hath hope in his death.

20:014:033 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:
           but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.

20:014:034 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any
           people.

20:014:035 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is
           against him that causeth shame.

20:015:001 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
           anger.

20:015:002 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth
           of fools poureth out foolishness.

20:015:003 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil
           and the good.

20:015:004 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein
           is a breach in the spirit.

20:015:005 A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that
           regardeth reproof is prudent.

20:015:006 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the
           revenues of the wicked is trouble.

20:015:007 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the
           foolish doeth not so.

20:015:008 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but
           the prayer of the upright is his delight.

20:015:009 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he
           loveth him that followeth after righteousness.

20:015:010 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he
           that hateth reproof shall die.

20:015:011 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then
           the hearts of the children of men?

20:015:012 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he
           go unto the wise.

20:015:013 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of
           the heart the spirit is broken.

20:015:014 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
           but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.

20:015:015 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a
           merry heart hath a continual feast.

20:015:016 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure
           and trouble therewith.

20:015:017 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox
           and hatred therewith.

20:015:018 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to
           anger appeaseth strife.

20:015:019 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the
           way of the righteous is made plain.

20:015:020 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth
           his mother.

20:015:021 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of
           understanding walketh uprightly.

20:015:022 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the
           multitude of counsellors they are established.

20:015:023 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken
           in due season, how good is it!

20:015:024 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from
           hell beneath.

20:015:025 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will
           establish the border of the widow.

20:015:026 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but
           the words of the pure are pleasant words.

20:015:027 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that
           hateth gifts shall live.

20:015:028 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth
           of the wicked poureth out evil things.

20:015:029 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of
           the righteous.

20:015:030 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report
           maketh the bones fat.

20:015:031 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the
           wise.

20:015:032 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he
           that heareth reproof getteth understanding.

20:015:033 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before
           honour is humility.

20:016:001 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the
           tongue, is from the LORD.

20:016:002 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD
           weigheth the spirits.

20:016:003 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be
           established.

20:016:004 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the
           wicked for the day of evil.

20:016:005 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the
           LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

20:016:006 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the
           LORD men depart from evil.

20:016:007 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies
           to be at peace with him.

20:016:008 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues
           without right.

20:016:009 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his
           steps.

20:016:010 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth
           transgresseth not in judgment.

20:016:011 A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of
           the bag are his work.

20:016:012 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the
           throne is established by righteousness.

20:016:013 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him
           that speaketh right.

20:016:014 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man
           will pacify it.

20:016:015 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour
           is as a cloud of the latter rain.

20:016:016 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get
           understanding rather to be chosen than silver!

20:016:017 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that
           keepeth his way preserveth his soul.

20:016:018 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a
           fall.

20:016:019 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
           divide the spoil with the proud.

20:016:020 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso
           trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.

20:016:021 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness
           of the lips increaseth learning.

20:016:022 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:
           but the instruction of fools is folly.

20:016:023 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning
           to his lips.

20:016:024 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and
           health to the bones.

20:016:025 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end
           thereof are the ways of death.

20:016:026 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth
           it of him.

20:016:027 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a
           burning fire.

20:016:028 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief
           friends.

20:016:029 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the
           way that is not good.

20:016:030 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips
           he bringeth evil to pass.

20:016:031 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way
           of righteousness.

20:016:032 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he
           that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

20:016:033 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof
           is of the LORD.

20:017:001 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house
           full of sacrifices with strife.

20:017:002 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
           and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.

20:017:003 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but
           the LORD trieth the hearts.

20:017:004 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear
           to a naughty tongue.

20:017:005 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is
           glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.

20:017:006 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of
           children are their fathers.

20:017:007 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips
           a prince.

20:017:008 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
           whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

20:017:009 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that
           repeateth a matter separateth very friends.

20:017:010 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred
           stripes into a fool.

20:017:011 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel
           messenger shall be sent against him.

20:017:012 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool
           in his folly.

20:017:013 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his
           house.

20:017:014 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
           therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.

20:017:015 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the
           just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.

20:017:016 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get
           wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?

20:017:017 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for
           adversity.

20:017:018 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh
           surety in the presence of his friend.

20:017:019 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that
           exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.

20:017:020 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath
           a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.

20:017:021 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the
           father of a fool hath no joy.

20:017:022 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit
           drieth the bones.

20:017:023 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the
           ways of judgment.

20:017:024 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of
           a fool are in the ends of the earth.

20:017:025 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her
           that bare him.

20:017:026 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for
           equity.

20:017:027 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of
           understanding is of an excellent spirit.

20:017:028 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and
           he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

20:018:001 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and
           intermeddleth with all wisdom.

20:018:002 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart
           may discover itself.

20:018:003 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with
           ignominy reproach.

20:018:004 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the
           wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.

20:018:005 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to
           overthrow the righteous in judgment.

20:018:006 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for
           strokes.

20:018:007 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare
           of his soul.

20:018:008 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
           the innermost parts of the belly.

20:018:009 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is
           a great waster.

20:018:010 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth
           into it, and is safe.

20:018:011 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall
           in his own conceit.

20:018:012 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before
           honour is humility.

20:018:013 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly
           and shame unto him.

20:018:014 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded
           spirit who can bear?

20:018:015 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the
           wise seeketh knowledge.

20:018:016 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before
           great men.

20:018:017 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his
           neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

20:018:018 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the
           mighty.

20:018:019 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and
           their contentions are like the bars of a castle.

20:018:020 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
           and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

20:018:021 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that
           love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

20:018:022 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth
           favour of the LORD.

20:018:023 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.

20:018:024 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there
           is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

20:019:001 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that
           is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

20:019:002 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and
           he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.

20:019:003 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart
           fretteth against the LORD.

20:019:004 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
           neighbour.

20:019:005 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
           lies shall not escape.

20:019:006 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a
           friend to him that giveth gifts.

20:019:007 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his
           friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they
           are wanting to him.

20:019:008 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth
           understanding shall find good.

20:019:009 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
           lies shall perish.

20:019:010 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to
           have rule over princes.

20:019:011 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his
           glory to pass over a transgression.

20:019:012 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour
           is as dew upon the grass.

20:019:013 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the
           contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.

20:019:014 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent
           wife is from the LORD.

20:019:015 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall
           suffer hunger.

20:019:016 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he
           that despiseth his ways shall die.

20:019:017 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and
           that which he hath given will he pay him again.

20:019:018 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul
           spare for his crying.

20:019:019 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou
           deliver him, yet thou must do it again.

20:019:020 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be
           wise in thy latter end.

20:019:021 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the
           counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

20:019:022 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better
           than a liar.

20:019:023 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it
           shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.

20:019:024 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so
           much as bring it to his mouth again.

20:019:025 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one
           that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.

20:019:026 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a
           son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

20:019:027 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err
           from the words of knowledge.

20:019:028 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the
           wicked devoureth iniquity.

20:019:029 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back
           of fools.

20:020:001 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is
           deceived thereby is not wise.

20:020:002 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso
           provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.

20:020:003 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool
           will be meddling.

20:020:004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore
           shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.

20:020:005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of
           understanding will draw it out.

20:020:006 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a
           faithful man who can find?

20:020:007 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are
           blessed after him.

20:020:008 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away
           all evil with his eyes.

20:020:009 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
           sin?

20:020:010 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike
           abomination to the LORD.

20:020:011 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,
           and whether it be right.

20:020:012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even
           both of them.

20:020:013 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes,
           and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.

20:020:014 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is
           gone his way, then he boasteth.

20:020:015 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of
           knowledge are a precious jewel.

20:020:016 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a
           pledge of him for a strange woman.

20:020:017 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth
           shall be filled with gravel.

20:020:018 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice
           make war.

20:020:019 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:
           therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

20:020:020 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put
           out in obscure darkness.

20:020:021 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the
           end thereof shall not be blessed.

20:020:022 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD,
           and he shall save thee.

20:020:023 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false
           balance is not good.

20:020:024 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand
           his own way?

20:020:025 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and
           after vows to make enquiry.

20:020:026 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over
           them.

20:020:027 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the
           inward parts of the belly.

20:020:028 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden
           by mercy.

20:020:029 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of
           old men is the grey head.

20:020:030 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the
           inward parts of the belly.

20:021:001 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of
           water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

20:021:002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD
           pondereth the hearts.

20:021:003 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than
           sacrifice.

20:021:004 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the
           wicked, is sin.

20:021:005 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but
           of every one that is hasty only to want.

20:021:006 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed
           to and fro of them that seek death.

20:021:007 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they
           refuse to do judgment.

20:021:008 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure,
           his work is right.

20:021:009 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a
           brawling woman in a wide house.

20:021:010 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no
           favour in his eyes.

20:021:011 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and
           when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

20:021:012 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
           but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.

20:021:013 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall
           cry himself, but shall not be heard.

20:021:014 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom
           strong wrath.

20:021:015 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be
           to the workers of iniquity.

20:021:016 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall
           remain in the congregation of the dead.

20:021:017 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth
           wine and oil shall not be rich.

20:021:018 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the
           transgressor for the upright.

20:021:019 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a
           contentious and an angry woman.

20:021:020 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
           wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

20:021:021 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life,
           righteousness, and honour.

20:021:022 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down
           the strength of the confidence thereof.

20:021:023 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
           troubles.

20:021:024 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud
           wrath.

20:021:025 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse
           to labour.

20:021:026 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous
           giveth and spareth not.

20:021:027 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more,
           when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?

20:021:028 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth
           speaketh constantly.

20:021:029 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he
           directeth his way.

20:021:030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the
           LORD.

20:021:031 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is
           of the LORD.

20:022:001 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and
           loving favour rather than silver and gold.

20:022:002 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them
           all.

20:022:003 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the
           simple pass on, and are punished.

20:022:004 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour,
           and life.

20:022:005 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth
           keep his soul shall be far from them.

20:022:006 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old,
           he will not depart from it.

20:022:007 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to
           the lender.

20:022:008 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his
           anger shall fail.

20:022:009 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth
           of his bread to the poor.

20:022:010 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife
           and reproach shall cease.

20:022:011 He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips
           the king shall be his friend.

20:022:012 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth
           the words of the transgressor.

20:022:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be
           slain in the streets.

20:022:014 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred
           of the LORD shall fall therein.

20:022:015 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of
           correction shall drive it far from him.

20:022:016 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he
           that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.

20:022:017 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply
           thine heart unto my knowledge.

20:022:018 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they
           shall withal be fitted in thy lips.

20:022:019 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee
           this day, even to thee.

20:022:020 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and
           knowledge,

20:022:021 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of
           truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them
           that send unto thee?

20:022:022 Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the
           afflicted in the gate:

20:022:023 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of
           those that spoiled them.

20:022:024 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man
           thou shalt not go:

20:022:025 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.

20:022:026 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are
           sureties for debts.

20:022:027 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed
           from under thee?

20:022:028 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.

20:022:029 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand
           before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.

20:023:001 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently
           what is before thee:

20:023:002 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to
           appetite.

20:023:003 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.

20:023:004 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

20:023:005 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches
           certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle
           toward heaven.

20:023:006 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither
           desire thou his dainty meats:

20:023:007 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink,
           saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.

20:023:008 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose
           thy sweet words.

20:023:009 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the
           wisdom of thy words.

20:023:010 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of
           the fatherless:

20:023:011 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with
           thee.

20:023:012 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the
           words of knowledge.

20:023:013 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest
           him with the rod, he shall not die.

20:023:014 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul
           from hell.

20:023:015 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even
           mine.

20:023:016 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

20:023:017 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of
           the LORD all the day long.

20:023:018 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be
           cut off.

20:023:019 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the
           way.

20:023:020 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

20:023:021 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and
           drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.

20:023:022 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy
           mother when she is old.

20:023:023 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,
           and understanding.

20:023:024 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that
           begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.

20:023:025 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare
           thee shall rejoice.

20:023:026 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my
           ways.

20:023:027 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow
           pit.

20:023:028 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the
           transgressors among men.

20:023:029 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath
           babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of
           eyes?

20:023:030 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed
           wine.

20:023:031 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his
           colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

20:023:032 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an
           adder.

20:023:033 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall
           utter perverse things.

20:023:034 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the
           sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

20:023:035 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick;
           they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I
           will seek it yet again.

20:024:001 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be
           with them.

20:024:002 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of
           mischief.

20:024:003 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is
           established:

20:024:004 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all
           precious and pleasant riches.

20:024:005 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth
           strength.

20:024:006 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude
           of counsellors there is safety.

20:024:007 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the
           gate.

20:024:008 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous
           person.

20:024:009 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an
           abomination to men.

20:024:010 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.

20:024:011 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and
           those that are ready to be slain;

20:024:012 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that
           pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul,
           doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man
           according to his works?

20:024:013 My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb,
           which is sweet to thy taste:

20:024:014 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou
           hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy
           expectation shall not be cut off.

20:024:015 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the
           righteous; spoil not his resting place:

20:024:016 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but
           the wicked shall fall into mischief.

20:024:017 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart
           be glad when he stumbleth:

20:024:018 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away
           his wrath from him.

20:024:019 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious
           at the wicked:

20:024:020 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of
           the wicked shall be put out.

20:024:021 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with
           them that are given to change:

20:024:022 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the
           ruin of them both?

20:024:023 These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have
           respect of persons in judgment.

20:024:024 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall
           the people curse, nations shall abhor him:

20:024:025 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good
           blessing shall come upon them.

20:024:026 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.

20:024:027 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the
           field; and afterwards build thine house.

20:024:028 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and
           deceive not with thy lips.

20:024:029 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will
           render to the man according to his work.

20:024:030 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of
           the man void of understanding;

20:024:031 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had
           covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was
           broken down.

20:024:032 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and
           received instruction.

20:024:033 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
           hands to sleep:

20:024:034 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want
           as an armed man.

20:025:001 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
           king of Judah copied out.

20:025:002 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of
           kings is to search out a matter.

20:025:003 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart
           of kings is unsearchable.

20:025:004 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come
           forth a vessel for the finer.

20:025:005 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne
           shall be established in righteousness.

20:025:006 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand
           not in the place of great men:

20:025:007 For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither;
           than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the
           prince whom thine eyes have seen.

20:025:008 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do
           in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.

20:025:009 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not
           a secret to another:

20:025:010 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy
           turn not away.

20:025:011 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of
           silver.

20:025:012 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a
           wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

20:025:013 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
           messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of
           his masters.

20:025:014 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind
           without rain.

20:025:015 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue
           breaketh the bone.

20:025:016 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
           lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.

20:025:017 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary
           of thee, and so hate thee.

20:025:018 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a
           maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.

20:025:019 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a
           broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.

20:025:020 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as
           vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy
           heart.

20:025:021 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be
           thirsty, give him water to drink:

20:025:022 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD
           shall reward thee.

20:025:023 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance
           a backbiting tongue.

20:025:024 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with
           a brawling woman and in a wide house.

20:025:025 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far
           country.

20:025:026 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a
           troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.

20:025:027 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their
           own glory is not glory.

20:025:028 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that
           is broken down, and without walls.

20:026:001 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not
           seemly for a fool.

20:026:002 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the
           curse causeless shall not come.

20:026:003 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the
           fool's back.

20:026:004 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be
           like unto him.

20:026:005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his
           own conceit.

20:026:006 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off
           the feet, and drinketh damage.

20:026:007 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the
           mouth of fools.

20:026:008 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth
           honour to a fool.

20:026:009 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a
           parable in the mouths of fools.

20:026:010 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool,
           and rewardeth transgressors.

20:026:011 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his
           folly.

20:026:012 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope
           of a fool than of him.

20:026:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is
           in the streets.

20:026:014 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon
           his bed.

20:026:015 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to
           bring it again to his mouth.

20:026:016 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that
           can render a reason.

20:026:017 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to
           him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.

20:026:018 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,

20:026:019 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not
           I in sport?

20:026:020 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is
           no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

20:026:021 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a
           contentious man to kindle strife.

20:026:022 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
           the innermost parts of the belly.

20:026:023 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered
           with silver dross.

20:026:024 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit
           within him;

20:026:025 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven
           abominations in his heart.

20:026:026 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
           shewed before the whole congregation.

20:026:027 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a
           stone, it will return upon him.

20:026:028 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a
           flattering mouth worketh ruin.

20:027:001 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a
           day may bring forth.

20:027:002 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a
           stranger, and not thine own lips.

20:027:003 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is
           heavier than them both.

20:027:004 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to
           stand before envy?

20:027:005 Open rebuke is better than secret love.

20:027:006 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an
           enemy are deceitful.

20:027:007 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul
           every bitter thing is sweet.

20:027:008 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that
           wandereth from his place.

20:027:009 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness
           of a man's friend by hearty counsel.

20:027:010 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
           neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy
           calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a
           brother far off.

20:027:011 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him
           that reproacheth me.

20:027:012 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the
           simple pass on, and are punished.

20:027:013 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a
           pledge of him for a strange woman.

20:027:014 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in
           the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

20:027:015 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious
           woman are alike.

20:027:016 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his
           right hand, which bewrayeth itself.

20:027:017 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of
           his friend.

20:027:018 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he
           that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

20:027:019 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to
           man.

20:027:020 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are
           never satisfied.

20:027:021 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is
           a man to his praise.

20:027:022 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with
           a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

20:027:023 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look
           well to thy herds.

20:027:024 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to
           every generation?

20:027:025 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and
           herbs of the mountains are gathered.

20:027:026 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of
           the field.

20:027:027 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the
           food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy
           maidens.

20:028:001 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are
           bold as a lion.

20:028:002 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof:
           but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof
           shall be prolonged.

20:028:003 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain
           which leaveth no food.

20:028:004 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep
           the law contend with them.

20:028:005 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD
           understand all things.

20:028:006 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he
           that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.

20:028:007 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a
           companion of riotous men shameth his father.

20:028:008 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he
           shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

20:028:009 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his
           prayer shall be abomination.

20:028:010 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he
           shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall
           have good things in possession.

20:028:011 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that
           hath understanding searcheth him out.

20:028:012 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when
           the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

20:028:013 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso
           confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

20:028:014 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his
           heart shall fall into mischief.

20:028:015 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler
           over the poor people.

20:028:016 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great
           oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his
           days.

20:028:017 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall
           flee to the pit; let no man stay him.

20:028:018 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is
           perverse in his ways shall fall at once.

20:028:019 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he
           that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.

20:028:020 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh
           haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

20:028:021 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of
           bread that man will transgress.

20:028:022 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth
           not that poverty shall come upon him.

20:028:023 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than
           he that flattereth with the tongue.

20:028:024 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no
           transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.

20:028:025 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that
           putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

20:028:026 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh
           wisely, he shall be delivered.

20:028:027 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that
           hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

20:028:028 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they
           perish, the righteous increase.

20:029:001 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall
           suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.

20:029:002 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but
           when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.

20:029:003 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth
           company with harlots spendeth his substance.

20:029:004 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that
           receiveth gifts overthroweth it.

20:029:005 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his
           feet.

20:029:006 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the
           righteous doth sing and rejoice.

20:029:007 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the
           wicked regardeth not to know it.

20:029:008 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away
           wrath.

20:029:009 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage
           or laugh, there is no rest.

20:029:010 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.

20:029:011 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in
           till afterwards.

20:029:012 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.

20:029:013 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD
           lighteneth both their eyes.

20:029:014 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be
           established for ever.

20:029:015 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself
           bringeth his mother to shame.

20:029:016 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but
           the righteous shall see their fall.

20:029:017 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall
           give delight unto thy soul.

20:029:018 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that
           keepeth the law, happy is he.

20:029:019 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he
           understand he will not answer.

20:029:020 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more
           hope of a fool than of him.

20:029:021 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall
           have him become his son at the length.

20:029:022 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth
           in transgression.

20:029:023 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the
           humble in spirit.

20:029:024 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth
           cursing, and bewrayeth it not.

20:029:025 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust
           in the LORD shall be safe.

20:029:026 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh
           from the LORD.

20:029:027 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is
           upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

20:030:001 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man
           spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,

20:030:002 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the
           understanding of a man.

20:030:003 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

20:030:004 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath
           gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a
           garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what
           is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?

20:030:005 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put
           their trust in him.

20:030:006 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be
           found a liar.

20:030:007 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I
           die:

20:030:008 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty
           nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:

20:030:009 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or
           lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in
           vain.

20:030:010 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and
           thou be found guilty.

20:030:011 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not
           bless their mother.

20:030:012 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet
           is not washed from their filthiness.

20:030:013 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their
           eyelids are lifted up.

20:030:014 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their
           jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth,
           and the needy from among men.

20:030:015 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There
           are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things
           say not, It is enough:

20:030:016 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled
           with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.

20:030:017 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his
           mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the
           young eagles shall eat it.

20:030:018 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea,
           four which I know not:

20:030:019 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a
           rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way
           of a man with a maid.

20:030:020 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth
           her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

20:030:021 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which
           it cannot bear:

20:030:022 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled
           with meat;

20:030:023 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that
           is heir to her mistress.

20:030:024 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they
           are exceeding wise:

20:030:025 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat
           in the summer;

20:030:026 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses
           in the rocks;

20:030:027 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by
           bands;

20:030:028 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings'
           palaces.

20:030:029 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in
           going:

20:030:030 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away
           for any;

20:030:031 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there
           is no rising up.

20:030:032 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou
           hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.

20:030:033 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the
           wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of
           wrath bringeth forth strife.

20:031:001 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught
           him.

20:031:002 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son
           of my vows?

20:031:003 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which
           destroyeth kings.

20:031:004 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink
           wine; nor for princes strong drink:

20:031:005 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment
           of any of the afflicted.

20:031:006 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine
           unto those that be of heavy hearts.

20:031:007 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery
           no more.

20:031:008 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are
           appointed to destruction.

20:031:009 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the
           poor and needy.

20:031:010 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above
           rubies.

20:031:011 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he
           shall have no need of spoil.

20:031:012 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

20:031:013 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her
           hands.

20:031:014 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from
           afar.

20:031:015 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her
           household, and a portion to her maidens.

20:031:016 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her
           hands she planteth a vineyard.

20:031:017 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her
           arms.

20:031:018 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth
           not out by night.

20:031:019 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the
           distaff.

20:031:020 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth
           forth her hands to the needy.

20:031:021 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
           household are clothed with scarlet.

20:031:022 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk
           and purple.

20:031:023 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
           elders of the land.

20:031:024 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles
           unto the merchant.

20:031:025 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in
           time to come.

20:031:026 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the
           law of kindness.

20:031:027 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not
           the bread of idleness.

20:031:028 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
           and he praiseth her.

20:031:029 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them
           all.

20:031:030 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that
           feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

20:031:031 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works
           praise her in the gates.

Book 21        Ecclesiastes

21:001:001 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in
           Jerusalem.

21:001:002 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities;
           all is vanity.

21:001:003 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under
           the sun?

21:001:004 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:
           but the earth abideth for ever.

21:001:005 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to
           his place where he arose.

21:001:006 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the
           north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth
           again according to his circuits.

21:001:007 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto
           the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return
           again.

21:001:008 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is
           not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

21:001:009 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that
           which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new
           thing under the sun.

21:001:010 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?
           it hath been already of old time, which was before us.

21:001:011 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there
           be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that
           shall come after.

21:001:012 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

21:001:013 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
           concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore
           travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised
           therewith.

21:001:014 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
           behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

21:001:015 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which
           is wanting cannot be numbered.

21:001:016 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
           estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have
           been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great
           experience of wisdom and knowledge.

21:001:017 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
           folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

21:001:018 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
           knowledge increaseth sorrow.

21:002:001 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
           therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.

21:002:002 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

21:002:003 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet
           acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly,
           till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which
           they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.

21:002:004 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
           vineyards:

21:002:005 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of
           all kind of fruits:

21:002:006 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that
           bringeth forth trees:

21:002:007 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my
           house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
           above all that were in Jerusalem before me:

21:002:008 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
           of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
           singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical
           instruments, and that of all sorts.

21:002:009 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
           me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

21:002:010 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I
           withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in
           all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.

21:002:011 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and
           on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was
           vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under
           the sun.

21:002:012 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:
           for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that
           which hath been already done.

21:002:013 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light
           excelleth darkness.

21:002:014 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
           darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth
           to them all.

21:002:015 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
           happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I
           said in my heart, that this also is vanity.

21:002:016 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool
           for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall
           all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.

21:002:017 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
           the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of
           spirit.

21:002:018 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
           because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

21:002:019 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
           shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured,
           and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is
           also vanity.

21:002:020 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
           labour which I took under the sun.

21:002:021 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in
           knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured
           therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity
           and a great evil.

21:002:022 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of
           his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?

21:002:023 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his
           heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

21:002:024 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
           drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his
           labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

21:002:025 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?

21:002:026 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
           knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to
           gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good
           before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

21:003:001 To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose
           under the heaven:

21:003:002 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a
           time to pluck up that which is planted;

21:003:003 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and
           a time to build up;

21:003:004 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a
           time to dance;

21:003:005 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones
           together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
           embracing;

21:003:006 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
           to cast away;

21:003:007 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and
           a time to speak;

21:003:008 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time
           of peace.

21:003:009 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

21:003:010 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of
           men to be exercised in it.

21:003:011 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath
           set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the
           work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

21:003:012 I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to
           rejoice, and to do good in his life.

21:003:013 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the
           good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.

21:003:014 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever:
           nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God
           doeth it, that men should fear before him.

21:003:015 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath
           already been; and God requireth that which is past.

21:003:016 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
           wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that
           iniquity was there.

21:003:017 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
           wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for
           every work.

21:003:018 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
           that God might manifest them, and that they might see that
           they themselves are beasts.

21:003:019 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
           even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
           other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
           preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.

21:003:020 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
           dust again.

21:003:021 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the
           spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

21:003:022 Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a
           man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion:
           for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

21:004:001 So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are
           done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were
           oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their
           oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.

21:004:002 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than
           the living which are yet alive.

21:004:003 Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who
           hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

21:004:004 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that
           for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity
           and vexation of spirit.

21:004:005 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

21:004:006 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full
           with travail and vexation of spirit.

21:004:007 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

21:004:008 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath
           neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his
           labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither
           saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?
           This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.

21:004:009 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for
           their labour.

21:004:010 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to
           him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to
           help him up.

21:004:011 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can
           one be warm alone?

21:004:012 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a
           threefold cord is not quickly broken.

21:004:013 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish
           king, who will no more be admonished.

21:004:014 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is
           born in his kingdom becometh poor.

21:004:015 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the
           second child that shall stand up in his stead.

21:004:016 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been
           before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in
           him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

21:005:001 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more
           ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they
           consider not that they do evil.

21:005:002 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty
           to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou
           upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.

21:005:003 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a
           fool's voice is known by multitude of words.

21:005:004 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he
           hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

21:005:005 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou
           shouldest vow and not pay.

21:005:006 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say
           thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should
           God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine
           hands?

21:005:007 For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also
           divers vanities: but fear thou God.

21:005:008 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent
           perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not
           at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest
           regardeth; and there be higher than they.

21:005:009 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself
           is served by the field.

21:005:010 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor
           he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

21:005:011 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and
           what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding
           of them with their eyes?

21:005:012 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little
           or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to
           sleep.

21:005:013 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
           riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

21:005:014 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a
           son, and there is nothing in his hand.

21:005:015 As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return
           to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which
           he may carry away in his hand.

21:005:016 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came,
           so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for
           the wind?

21:005:017 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much
           sorrow and wrath with his sickness.

21:005:018 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one
           to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour
           that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which
           God giveth him: for it is his portion.

21:005:019 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and
           hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,
           and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

21:005:020 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because
           God answereth him in the joy of his heart.

21:006:001 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is
           common among men:

21:006:002 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so
           that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth,
           yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger
           eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.

21:006:003 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so
           that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled
           with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an
           untimely birth is better than he.

21:006:004 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and
           his name shall be covered with darkness.

21:006:005 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this
           hath more rest than the other.

21:006:006 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he
           seen no good: do not all go to one place?

21:006:007 All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite
           is not filled.

21:006:008 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
           that knoweth to walk before the living?

21:006:009 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
           desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

21:006:010 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it
           is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than
           he.

21:006:011 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man
           the better?

21:006:012 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the
           days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who
           can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?

21:007:001 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of
           death than the day of one's birth.

21:007:002 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
           house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the
           living will lay it to his heart.

21:007:003 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
           countenance the heart is made better.

21:007:004 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the
           heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

21:007:005 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
           hear the song of fools.

21:007:006 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter
           of the fool: this also is vanity.

21:007:007 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth
           the heart.

21:007:008 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and
           the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

21:007:009 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in
           the bosom of fools.

21:007:010 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were
           better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning
           this.

21:007:011 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit
           to them that see the sun.

21:007:012 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
           excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them
           that have it.

21:007:013 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight,
           which he hath made crooked?

21:007:014 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of
           adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the
           other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

21:007:015 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a
           just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a
           wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

21:007:016 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise:
           why shouldest thou destroy thyself?

21:007:017 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why
           shouldest thou die before thy time?

21:007:018 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also
           from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God
           shall come forth of them all.

21:007:019 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which
           are in the city.

21:007:020 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
           sinneth not.

21:007:021 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou
           hear thy servant curse thee:

21:007:022 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself
           likewise hast cursed others.

21:007:023 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but
           it was far from me.

21:007:024 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it
           out?

21:007:025 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
           wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness
           of folly, even of foolishness and madness:

21:007:026 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is
           snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God
           shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

21:007:027 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by
           one, to find out the account:

21:007:028 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a
           thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not
           found.

21:007:029 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
           but they have sought out many inventions.

21:008:001 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of
           a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the
           boldness of his face shall be changed.

21:008:002 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in
           regard of the oath of God.

21:008:003 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil
           thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

21:008:004 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say
           unto him, What doest thou?

21:008:005 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
           wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

21:008:006 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore
           the misery of man is great upon him.

21:008:007 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him
           when it shall be?

21:008:008 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the
           spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there
           is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver
           those that are given to it.

21:008:009 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work
           that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man
           ruleth over another to his own hurt.

21:008:010 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the
           place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where
           they had so done: this is also vanity.

21:008:011 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
           speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
           in them to do evil.

21:008:012 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be
           prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them
           that fear God, which fear before him:

21:008:013 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
           prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth
           not before God.

21:008:014 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
           just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the
           wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth
           according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also
           is vanity.

21:008:015 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
           under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for
           that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life,
           which God giveth him under the sun.

21:008:016 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the
           business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that
           neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

21:008:017 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out
           the work that is done under the sun: because though a man
           labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther;
           though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able
           to find it.

21:009:001 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all
           this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are
           in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by
           all that is before them.

21:009:002 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the
           righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean,
           and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
           sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that
           sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.

21:009:003 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun,
           that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the
           sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart
           while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

21:009:004 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for
           a living dog is better than a dead lion.

21:009:005 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
           any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
           of them is forgotten.

21:009:006 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
           perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any
           thing that is done under the sun.

21:009:007 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
           merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

21:009:008 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
           ointment.

21:009:009 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of
           the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the
           sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in
           this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.

21:009:010 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
           there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
           the grave, whither thou goest.

21:009:011 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the
           swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the
           wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour
           to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

21:009:012 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
           taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the
           snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
           falleth suddenly upon them.

21:009:013 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed
           great unto me:

21:009:014 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came
           a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great
           bulwarks against it:

21:009:015 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his
           wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same
           poor man.

21:009:016 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
           poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

21:009:017 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of
           him that ruleth among fools.

21:009:018 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner
           destroyeth much good.

21:010:001 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth
           a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in
           reputation for wisdom and honour.

21:010:002 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at
           his left.

21:010:003 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his
           wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a
           fool.

21:010:004 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
           place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

21:010:005 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error
           which proceedeth from the ruler:

21:010:006 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

21:010:007 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as
           servants upon the earth.

21:010:008 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh
           an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

21:010:009 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that
           cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

21:010:010 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must
           he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

21:010:011 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a
           babbler is no better.

21:010:012 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of
           a fool will swallow up himself.

21:010:013 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and
           the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

21:010:014 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
           and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

21:010:015 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because
           he knoweth not how to go to the city.

21:010:016 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
           eat in the morning!

21:010:017 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles,
           and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for
           drunkenness!

21:010:018 By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through
           idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

21:010:019 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
           answereth all things.

21:010:020 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
           rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the
           voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

21:011:001 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after
           many days.

21:011:002 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest
           not what evil shall be upon the earth.

21:011:003 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the
           earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the
           north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

21:011:004 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that
           regardeth the clouds shall not reap.

21:011:005 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the
           bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so
           thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

21:011:006 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not
           thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either
           this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

21:011:007 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
           eyes to behold the sun:

21:011:008 But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let
           him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All
           that cometh is vanity.

21:011:009 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
           thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
           heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for
           all these things God will bring thee into judgment.

21:011:010 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from
           thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.

21:012:001 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
           evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt
           say, I have no pleasure in them;

21:012:002 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
           darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:

21:012:003 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
           the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease
           because they are few, and those that look out of the windows
           be darkened,

21:012:004 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of
           the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the
           bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;

21:012:005 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and
           fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish,
           and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:
           because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about
           the streets:

21:012:006 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
           broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel
           broken at the cistern.

21:012:007 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
           spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

21:012:008 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.

21:012:009 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught
           the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,
           and set in order many proverbs.

21:012:010 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that
           which was written was upright, even words of truth.

21:012:011 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by
           the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.

21:012:012 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many
           books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the
           flesh.

21:012:013 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
           keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

21:012:014 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
           secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

Book 22        Song of Solomon

22:001:001 The song of songs, which is Solomon's.

22:001:002 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is
           better than wine.

22:001:003 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
           ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

22:001:004 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into
           his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will
           remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.

22:001:005 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the
           tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

22:001:006 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath
           looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they
           made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard
           have I not kept.

22:001:007 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where
           thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as
           one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

22:001:008 If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth
           by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the
           shepherds' tents.

22:001:009 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in
           Pharaoh's chariots.

22:001:010 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with
           chains of gold.

22:001:011 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

22:001:012 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth
           forth the smell thereof.

22:001:013 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all
           night betwixt my breasts.

22:001:014 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the
           vineyards of Engedi.

22:001:015 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
           hast doves' eyes.

22:001:016 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed
           is green.

22:001:017 The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.

22:002:001 I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.

22:002:002 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

22:002:003 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
           beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great
           delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

22:002:004 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me
           was love.

22:002:005 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of
           love.

22:002:006 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth
           embrace me.

22:002:007 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
           the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my
           love, till he please.

22:002:008 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the
           mountains, skipping upon the hills.

22:002:009 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth
           behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing
           himself through the lattice.

22:002:010 My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair
           one, and come away.

22:002:011 For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;

22:002:012 The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of
           birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
           land;

22:002:013 The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with
           the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair
           one, and come away.

22:002:014 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret
           places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear
           thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is
           comely.

22:002:015 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for
           our vines have tender grapes.

22:002:016 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

22:002:017 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my
           beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the
           mountains of Bether.

22:003:001 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought
           him, but I found him not.

22:003:002 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in
           the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought
           him, but I found him not.

22:003:003 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said,
           Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

22:003:004 It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him
           whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go,
           until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the
           chamber of her that conceived me.

22:003:005 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
           the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my
           love, till he please.

22:003:006 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of
           smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders
           of the merchant?

22:003:007 Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are
           about it, of the valiant of Israel.

22:003:008 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his
           sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

22:003:009 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

22:003:010 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of
           gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being
           paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.

22:003:011 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with
           the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his
           espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

22:004:001 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
           hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of
           goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

22:004:002 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which
           came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and
           none is barren among them.

22:004:003 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is
           comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within
           thy locks.

22:004:004 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury,
           whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty
           men.

22:004:005 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which
           feed among the lilies.

22:004:006 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me
           to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

22:004:007 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.

22:004:008 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon:
           look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon,
           from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

22:004:009 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast
           ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of
           thy neck.

22:004:010 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is
           thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all
           spices!

22:004:011 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk
           are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like
           the smell of Lebanon.

22:004:012 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a
           fountain sealed.

22:004:013 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant
           fruits; camphire, with spikenard,

22:004:014 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of
           frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

22:004:015 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams
           from Lebanon.

22:004:016 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my
           garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved
           come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

22:005:001 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have
           gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb
           with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O
           friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

22:005:002 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved
           that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my
           dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my
           locks with the drops of the night.

22:005:003 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed
           my feet; how shall I defile them?

22:005:004 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my
           bowels were moved for him.

22:005:005 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with
           myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the
           handles of the lock.

22:005:006 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,
           and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but
           I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

22:005:007 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me,
           they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil
           from me.

22:005:008 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved,
           that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.

22:005:009 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest
           among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved,
           that thou dost so charge us?

22:005:010 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten
           thousand.

22:005:011 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and
           black as a raven.

22:005:012 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters,
           washed with milk, and fitly set.

22:005:013 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips
           like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

22:005:014 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is
           as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.

22:005:015 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine
           gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

22:005:016 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is
           my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

22:006:001 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?
           whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with
           thee.

22:006:002 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of
           spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

22:006:003 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among
           the lilies.

22:006:004 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem,
           terrible as an army with banners.

22:006:005 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy
           hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

22:006:006 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the
           washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one
           barren among them.

22:006:007 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.

22:006:008 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and
           virgins without number.

22:006:009 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her
           mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The
           daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the
           concubines, and they praised her.

22:006:010 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the
           moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?

22:006:011 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the
           valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the
           pomegranates budded.

22:006:012 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of
           Amminadib.

22:006:013 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look
           upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the
           company of two armies.

22:007:001 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter!
           the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the
           hands of a cunning workman.

22:007:002 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor:
           thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

22:007:003 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

22:007:004 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools
           in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the
           tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.

22:007:005 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine
           head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.

22:007:006 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

22:007:007 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to
           clusters of grapes.

22:007:008 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the
           boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of
           the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;

22:007:009 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved,
           that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are
           asleep to speak.

22:007:010 I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.

22:007:011 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge
           in the villages.

22:007:012 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine
           flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the
           pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.

22:007:013 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of
           pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O
           my beloved.

22:008:001 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my
           mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
           yea, I should not be despised.

22:008:002 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who
           would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine
           of the juice of my pomegranate.

22:008:003 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand
           should embrace me.

22:008:004 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up,
           nor awake my love, until he please.

22:008:005 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon
           her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy
           mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that
           bare thee.

22:008:006 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm:
           for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave:
           the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most
           vehement flame.

22:008:007 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown
           it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for
           love, it would utterly be contemned.

22:008:008 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall
           we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

22:008:009 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver:
           and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of
           cedar.

22:008:010 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his
           eyes as one that found favour.

22:008:011 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard
           unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a
           thousand pieces of silver.

22:008:012 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon,
           must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof
           two hundred.

22:008:013 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to
           thy voice: cause me to hear it.

22:008:014 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a
           young hart upon the mountains of spices.

Book 23        Isaiah

23:001:001 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning
           Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and
           Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

23:001:002 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath
           spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they
           have rebelled against me.

23:001:003 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but
           Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.

23:001:004 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
           evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken
           the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto
           anger, they are gone away backward.

23:001:005 Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and
           more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

23:001:006 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no
           soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying
           sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither
           mollified with ointment.

23:001:007 Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire:
           your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is
           desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

23:001:008 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard,
           as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

23:001:009 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small
           remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been
           like unto Gomorrah.

23:001:010 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto
           the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

23:001:011 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
           saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and
           the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
           bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.

23:001:012 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at
           your hand, to tread my courts?

23:001:013 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto
           me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I
           cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.

23:001:014 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they
           are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.

23:001:015 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
           from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear:
           your hands are full of blood.

23:001:016 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings
           from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

23:001:017 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
           the fatherless, plead for the widow.

23:001:018 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though
           your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
           though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

23:001:019 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
           land:

23:001:020 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the
           sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

23:001:021 How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of
           judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.

23:001:022 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:

23:001:023 Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every
           one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not
           the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto
           them.

23:001:024 Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of
           Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me
           of mine enemies:

23:001:025 And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy
           dross, and take away all thy tin:

23:001:026 And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy
           counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be
           called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.

23:001:027 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
           righteousness.

23:001:028 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners
           shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be
           consumed.

23:001:029 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired,
           and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have
           chosen.

23:001:030 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden
           that hath no water.

23:001:031 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a
           spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall
           quench them.

23:002:001 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
           Jerusalem.

23:002:002 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain
           of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the
           mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all
           nations shall flow unto it.

23:002:003 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to
           the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;
           and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
           paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of
           the LORD from Jerusalem.

23:002:004 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
           people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and
           their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword
           against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

23:002:005 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the
           LORD.

23:002:006 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,
           because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers
           like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the
           children of strangers.

23:002:007 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there
           any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses,
           neither is there any end of their chariots:

23:002:008 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of
           their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:

23:002:009 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth
           himself: therefore forgive them not.

23:002:010 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of
           the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.

23:002:011 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness
           of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be
           exalted in that day.

23:002:012 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that
           is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and
           he shall be brought low:

23:002:013 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted
           up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

23:002:014 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that
           are lifted up,

23:002:015 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,

23:002:016 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant
           pictures.

23:002:017 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the
           haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall
           be exalted in that day.

23:002:018 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.

23:002:019 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the
           caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of
           his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

23:002:020 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his
           idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to
           worship, to the moles and to the bats;

23:002:021 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the
           ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his
           majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

23:002:022 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for
           wherein is he to be accounted of?

23:003:001 For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from
           Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole
           stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.

23:003:002 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the
           prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

23:003:003 The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the
           counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent
           orator.

23:003:004 And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall
           rule over them.

23:003:005 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and
           every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself
           proudly against the ancient, and the base against the
           honourable.

23:003:006 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
           father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let
           this ruin be under thy hand:

23:003:007 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer;
           for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a
           ruler of the people.

23:003:008 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their
           tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the
           eyes of his glory.

23:003:009 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and
           they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto
           their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.

23:003:010 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for
           they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

23:003:011 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward
           of his hands shall be given him.

23:003:012 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women
           rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee
           to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.

23:003:013 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the
           people.

23:003:014 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
           people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the
           vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

23:003:015 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
           faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

23:003:016 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are
           haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes,
           walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with
           their feet:

23:003:017 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the
           head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover
           their secret parts.

23:003:018 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their
           tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and
           their round tires like the moon,

23:003:019 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

23:003:020 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,
           and the tablets, and the earrings,

23:003:021 The rings, and nose jewels,

23:003:022 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the
           wimples, and the crisping pins,

23:003:023 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.

23:003:024 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there
           shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of
           well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding
           of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.

23:003:025 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

23:003:026 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate
           shall sit upon the ground.

23:004:001 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man,
           saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel:
           only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.

23:004:002 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and
           glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and
           comely for them that are escaped of Israel.

23:004:003 And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and
           he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even
           every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:

23:004:004 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the
           daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of
           Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment,
           and by the spirit of burning.

23:004:005 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount
           Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and
           the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory
           shall be a defence.

23:004:006 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time
           from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert
           from storm and from rain.

23:005:001 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved
           touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a
           very fruitful hill:

23:005:002 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and
           planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the
           midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked
           that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild
           grapes.

23:005:003 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
           I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

23:005:004 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not
           done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring
           forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?

23:005:005 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard:
           I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up;
           and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:

23:005:006 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged;
           but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command
           the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

23:005:007 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,
           and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for
           judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold
           a cry.

23:005:008 Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to
           field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone
           in the midst of the earth!

23:005:009 In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses
           shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

23:005:010 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed
           of an homer shall yield an ephah.

23:005:011 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
           follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine
           inflame them!

23:005:012 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine,
           are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD,
           neither consider the operation of his hands.

23:005:013 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have
           no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their
           multitude dried up with thirst.

23:005:014 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth
           without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and
           their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

23:005:015 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man
           shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:

23:005:016 But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God
           that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.

23:005:017 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste
           places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

23:005:018 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin
           as it were with a cart rope:

23:005:019 That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may
           see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw
           nigh and come, that we may know it!

23:005:020 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put
           darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter
           for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

23:005:021 Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in
           their own sight!

23:005:022 Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of
           strength to mingle strong drink:

23:005:023 Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
           righteousness of the righteous from him!

23:005:024 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
           consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and
           their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away
           the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the
           Holy One of Israel.

23:005:025 Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people,
           and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath
           smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases
           were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger
           is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

23:005:026 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and
           will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold,
           they shall come with speed swiftly:

23:005:027 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber
           nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed,
           nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:

23:005:028 Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses'
           hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a
           whirlwind:

23:005:029 Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young
           lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and
           shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.

23:005:030 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring
           of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and
           sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

23:006:001 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting
           upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the
           temple.

23:006:002 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with
           twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
           and with twain he did fly.

23:006:003 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
           LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

23:006:004 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that
           cried, and the house was filled with smoke.

23:006:005 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
           unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean
           lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

23:006:006 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in
           his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the
           altar:

23:006:007 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched
           thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin
           purged.

23:006:008 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send,
           and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.

23:006:009 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but
           understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.

23:006:010 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,
           and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear
           with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert,
           and be healed.

23:006:011 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities
           be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and
           the land be utterly desolate,

23:006:012 And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great
           forsaking in the midst of the land.

23:006:013 But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall
           be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in
           them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be
           the substance thereof.

23:007:001 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the
           son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria,
           and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward
           Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.

23:007:002 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is
           confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the
           heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with
           the wind.

23:007:003 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz,
           thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of
           the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;

23:007:004 And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither
           be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands,
           for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of
           Remaliah.

23:007:005 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken
           evil counsel against thee, saying,

23:007:006 Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a
           breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even
           the son of Tabeal:

23:007:007 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it
           come to pass.

23:007:008 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is
           Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be
           broken, that it be not a people.

23:007:009 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
           Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
           established.

23:007:010 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

23:007:011 Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the
           depth, or in the height above.

23:007:012 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.

23:007:013 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small
           thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

23:007:014 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a
           virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
           Immanuel.

23:007:015 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the
           evil, and choose the good.

23:007:016 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose
           the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of
           both her kings.

23:007:017 The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon
           thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that
           Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.

23:007:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
           hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers
           of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

23:007:019 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the
           desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all
           thorns, and upon all bushes.

23:007:020 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is
           hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of
           Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also
           consume the beard.

23:007:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall
           nourish a young cow, and two sheep;

23:007:022 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they
           shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall
           every one eat that is left in the land.

23:007:023 And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall
           be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand
           silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.

23:007:024 With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all
           the land shall become briers and thorns.

23:007:025 And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there
           shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it
           shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading
           of lesser cattle.

23:008:001 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and
           write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.

23:008:002 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the
           priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

23:008:003 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a
           son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name
           Mahershalalhashbaz.

23:008:004 For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father,
           and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
           shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

23:008:005 The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,

23:008:006 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that
           go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

23:008:007 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the
           waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of
           Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his
           channels, and go over all his banks:

23:008:008 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go
           over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out
           of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

23:008:009 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in
           pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird
           yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves,
           and ye shall be broken in pieces.

23:008:010 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the
           word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

23:008:011 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and
           instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this
           people, saying,

23:008:012 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people
           shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be
           afraid.

23:008:013 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear,
           and let him be your dread.

23:008:014 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling
           and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a
           gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

23:008:015 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken,
           and be snared, and be taken.

23:008:016 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

23:008:017 And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the
           house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

23:008:018 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for
           signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which
           dwelleth in mount Zion.

23:008:019 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have
           familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter:
           should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the
           dead?

23:008:020 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
           to this word, it is because there is no light in them.

23:008:021 And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and
           it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they
           shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and
           look upward.

23:008:022 And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and
           darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to
           darkness.

23:009:001 Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her
           vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of
           Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more
           grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan,
           in Galilee of the nations.

23:009:002 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light:
           they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
           hath the light shined.

23:009:003 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy:
           they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as
           men rejoice when they divide the spoil.

23:009:004 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of
           his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of
           Midian.

23:009:005 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
           garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and
           fuel of fire.

23:009:006 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
           government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
           called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
           Father, The Prince of Peace.

23:009:007 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no
           end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order
           it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
           henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will
           perform this.

23:009:008 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon
           Israel.

23:009:009 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant
           of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

23:009:010 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn
           stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them
           into cedars.

23:009:011 Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin
           against him, and join his enemies together;

23:009:012 The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall
           devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not
           turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

23:009:013 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither
           do they seek the LORD of hosts.

23:009:014 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail,
           branch and rush, in one day.

23:009:015 The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet
           that teacheth lies, he is the tail.

23:009:016 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they
           that are led of them are destroyed.

23:009:017 Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men,
           neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for
           every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth
           speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but
           his hand is stretched out still.

23:009:018 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers
           and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest,
           and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

23:009:019 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened,
           and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall
           spare his brother.

23:009:020 And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he
           shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied:
           they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:

23:009:021 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together
           shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned
           away, but his hand is stretched out still.

23:010:001 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
           grievousness which they have prescribed;

23:010:002 To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the
           right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their
           prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!

23:010:003 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
           desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for
           help? and where will ye leave your glory?

23:010:004 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they
           shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not
           turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

23:010:005 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand
           is mine indignation.

23:010:006 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against
           the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the
           spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the
           mire of the streets.

23:010:007 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so;
           but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a
           few.

23:010:008 For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?

23:010:009 Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not
           Samaria as Damascus?

23:010:010 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose
           graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

23:010:011 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do
           to Jerusalem and her idols?

23:010:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath
           performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I
           will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of
           Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

23:010:013 For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and
           by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds
           of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put
           down the inhabitants like a valiant man:

23:010:014 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and
           as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the
           earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the
           mouth, or peeped.

23:010:015 Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?
           or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?
           as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it
           up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no
           wood.

23:010:016 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his
           fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a
           burning like the burning of a fire.

23:010:017 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
           for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his
           briers in one day;

23:010:018 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful
           field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a
           standard-bearer fainteth.

23:010:019 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
           child may write them.

23:010:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
           Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall
           no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay
           upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

23:010:021 The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
           mighty God.

23:010:022 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
           remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall
           overflow with righteousness.

23:010:023 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even
           determined, in the midst of all the land.

23:010:024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that
           dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall
           smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against
           thee, after the manner of Egypt.

23:010:025 For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease,
           and mine anger in their destruction.

23:010:026 And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him
           according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and
           as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the
           manner of Egypt.

23:010:027 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall
           be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy
           neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the
           anointing.

23:010:028 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he
           hath laid up his carriages:

23:010:029 They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their
           lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

23:010:030 Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard
           unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

23:010:031 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather
           themselves to flee.

23:010:032 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his
           hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of
           Jerusalem.

23:010:033 Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with
           terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and
           the haughty shall be humbled.

23:010:034 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
           and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

23:011:001 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and
           a Branch shall grow out of his roots:

23:011:002 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of
           wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
           spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;

23:011:003 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the
           LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,
           neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:

23:011:004 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove
           with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the
           earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his
           lips shall he slay the wicked.

23:011:005 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
           faithfulness the girdle of his reins.

23:011:006 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
           lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the
           fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.

23:011:007 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall
           lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

23:011:008 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and
           the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.

23:011:009 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for
           the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the
           waters cover the sea.

23:011:010 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
           stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles
           seek: and his rest shall be glorious.

23:011:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set
           his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his
           people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and
           from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar,
           and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

23:011:012 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
           assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the
           dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

23:011:013 The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of
           Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and
           Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

23:011:014 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines
           toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together:
           they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children
           of Ammon shall obey them.

23:011:015 And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian
           sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the
           river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men
           go over dryshod.

23:011:016 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people,
           which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in
           the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

23:012:001 And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee:
           though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away,
           and thou comfortedst me.

23:012:002 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid:
           for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is
           become my salvation.

23:012:003 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
           salvation.

23:012:004 And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his
           name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that
           his name is exalted.

23:012:005 Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is
           known in all the earth.

23:012:006 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the
           Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.

23:013:001 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

23:013:002 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice
           unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of
           the nobles.

23:013:003 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my
           mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my
           highness.

23:013:004 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great
           people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered
           together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

23:013:005 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the
           LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole
           land.

23:013:006 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as
           a destruction from the Almighty.

23:013:007 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart
           shall melt:

23:013:008 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of
           them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they
           shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as
           flames.

23:013:009 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and
           fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy
           the sinners thereof out of it.

23:013:010 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall
           not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going
           forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

23:013:011 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for
           their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to
           cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

23:013:012 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man
           than the golden wedge of Ophir.

23:013:013 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove
           out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in
           the day of his fierce anger.

23:013:014 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man
           taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and
           flee every one into his own land.

23:013:015 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one
           that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.

23:013:016 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their
           eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

23:013:017 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not
           regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

23:013:018 Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they
           shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall
           not spare children.

23:013:019 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the
           Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
           Gomorrah.

23:013:020 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from
           generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent
           there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.

23:013:021 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their
           houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall
           dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.

23:013:022 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate
           houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is
           near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

23:014:001 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
           Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers
           shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house
           of Jacob.

23:014:002 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place:
           and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the
           LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them
           captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over
           their oppressors.

23:014:003 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give
           thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the
           hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,

23:014:004 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of
           Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden
           city ceased!

23:014:005 The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre
           of the rulers.

23:014:006 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he
           that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none
           hindereth.

23:014:007 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth
           into singing.

23:014:008 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,
           saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against
           us.

23:014:009 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy
           coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief
           ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all
           the kings of the nations.

23:014:010 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become
           weak as we? art thou become like unto us?

23:014:011 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy
           viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover
           thee.

23:014:012 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
           morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst
           weaken the nations!

23:014:013 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven,
           I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also
           upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

23:014:014 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like
           the most High.

23:014:015 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the
           pit.

23:014:016 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider
           thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble,
           that did shake kingdoms;

23:014:017 That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
           thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

23:014:018 All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory,
           every one in his own house.

23:014:019 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,
           and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through
           with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a
           carcase trodden under feet.

23:014:020 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou
           hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of
           evildoers shall never be renowned.

23:014:021 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
           fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill
           the face of the world with cities.

23:014:022 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and
           cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and
           nephew, saith the LORD.

23:014:023 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
           water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction,
           saith the LORD of hosts.

23:014:024 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have
           thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so
           shall it stand:

23:014:025 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my
           mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart
           from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.

23:014:026 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and
           this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

23:014:027 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul
           it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

23:014:028 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

23:014:029 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that
           smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come
           forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying
           serpent.

23:014:030 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall
           lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and
           he shall slay thy remnant.

23:014:031 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art
           dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and
           none shall be alone in his appointed times.

23:014:032 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That
           the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall
           trust in it.

23:015:001 The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
           waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of
           Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;

23:015:002 He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to
           weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their
           heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.

23:015:003 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on
           the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one
           shall howl, weeping abundantly.

23:015:004 And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard
           even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall
           cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.

23:015:005 My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto
           Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of
           Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of
           Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.

23:015:006 For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is
           withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.

23:015:007 Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they
           have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the
           willows.

23:015:008 For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the
           howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto
           Beerelim.

23:015:009 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will
           bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab,
           and upon the remnant of the land.

23:016:001 Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
           wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

23:016:002 For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the
           nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

23:016:003 Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night
           in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him
           that wandereth.

23:016:004 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to
           them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at
           an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out
           of the land.

23:016:005 And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit
           upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and
           seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.

23:016:006 We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of
           his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies
           shall not be so.

23:016:007 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for
           the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are
           stricken.

23:016:008 For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah:
           the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants
           thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through
           the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone
           over the sea.

23:016:009 Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
           Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and
           Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy
           harvest is fallen.

23:016:010 And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful
           field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither
           shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine
           in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.

23:016:011 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and
           mine inward parts for Kirharesh.

23:016:012 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary
           on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to
           pray; but he shall not prevail.

23:016:013 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab
           since that time.

23:016:014 But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as
           the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be
           contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant
           shall be very small and feeble.

23:017:001 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from
           being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.

23:017:002 The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks,
           which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

23:017:003 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom
           from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the
           glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.

23:017:004 And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob
           shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax
           lean.

23:017:005 And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and
           reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that
           gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.

23:017:006 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an
           olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost
           bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof,
           saith the LORD God of Israel.

23:017:007 At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall
           have respect to the Holy One of Israel.

23:017:008 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,
           neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either
           the groves, or the images.

23:017:009 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough,
           and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the
           children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.

23:017:010 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast
           not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt
           thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange
           slips:

23:017:011 In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the
           morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest
           shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

23:017:012 Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like
           the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that
           make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!

23:017:013 The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but
           God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall
           be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and
           like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.

23:017:014 And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he
           is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot
           of them that rob us.

23:018:001 Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the
           rivers of Ethiopia:

23:018:002 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
           bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to
           a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their
           beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose
           land the rivers have spoiled!

23:018:003 All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth,
           see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and
           when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.

23:018:004 For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will
           consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs,
           and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

23:018:005 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour
           grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the
           sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the
           branches.

23:018:006 They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains,
           and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer
           upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon
           them.

23:018:007 In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of
           hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people
           terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and
           trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the
           place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.

23:019:001 The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift
           cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall
           be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in
           the midst of it.

23:019:002 And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they
           shall fight every one against his brother, and every one
           against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against
           kingdom.

23:019:003 And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I
           will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the
           idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar
           spirits, and to the wizards.

23:019:004 And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel
           lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord,
           the LORD of hosts.

23:019:005 And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be
           wasted and dried up.

23:019:006 And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of
           defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags
           shall wither.

23:019:007 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and
           every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away,
           and be no more.

23:019:008 The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle
           into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon
           the waters shall languish.

23:019:009 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave
           networks, shall be confounded.

23:019:010 And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that
           make sluices and ponds for fish.

23:019:011 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise
           counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto
           Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

23:019:012 Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee
           now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed
           upon Egypt.

23:019:013 The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are
           deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the
           stay of the tribes thereof.

23:019:014 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof:
           and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a
           drunken man staggereth in his vomit.

23:019:015 Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or
           tail, branch or rush, may do.

23:019:016 In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be
           afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD
           of hosts, which he shaketh over it.

23:019:017 And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one
           that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself,
           because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath
           determined against it.

23:019:018 In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the
           language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall
           be called, The city of destruction.

23:019:019 In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst
           of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to
           the LORD.

23:019:020 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of
           hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD
           because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour,
           and a great one, and he shall deliver them.

23:019:021 And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall
           know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and
           oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform
           it.

23:019:022 And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it:
           and they shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be
           intreated of them, and shall heal them.

23:019:023 In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
           and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into
           Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

23:019:024 In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with
           Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land:

23:019:025 Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt
           my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine
           inheritance.

23:020:001 In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the
           king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took
           it;

23:020:002 At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
           saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put
           off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and
           barefoot.

23:020:003 And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked
           and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and
           upon Ethiopia;

23:020:004 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians
           prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked
           and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame
           of Egypt.

23:020:005 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their
           expectation, and of Egypt their glory.

23:020:006 And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold,
           such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be
           delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?

23:021:001 The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the
           south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a
           terrible land.

23:021:002 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer
           dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O
           Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to
           cease.

23:021:003 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold
           upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed
           down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.

23:021:004 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my
           pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.

23:021:005 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise,
           ye princes, and anoint the shield.

23:021:006 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let
           him declare what he seeth.

23:021:007 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of
           asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently
           with much heed:

23:021:008 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the
           watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole
           nights:

23:021:009 And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of
           horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is
           fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken
           unto the ground.

23:021:010 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have
           heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared
           unto you.

23:021:011 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,
           what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

23:021:012 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if
           ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.

23:021:013 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye
           lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

23:021:014 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that
           was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.

23:021:015 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from
           the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

23:021:016 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according
           to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall
           fail:

23:021:017 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of
           the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God
           of Israel hath spoken it.

23:022:001 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that
           thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?

23:022:002 Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city:
           thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in
           battle.

23:022:003 All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the
           archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which
           have fled from far.

23:022:004 Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly,
           labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the
           daughter of my people.

23:022:005 For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of
           perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision,
           breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.

23:022:006 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen,
           and Kir uncovered the shield.

23:022:007 And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be
           full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in
           array at the gate.

23:022:008 And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look
           in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.

23:022:009 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they
           are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower
           pool.

23:022:010 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses
           have ye broken down to fortify the wall.

23:022:011 Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of
           the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof,
           neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.

23:022:012 And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and
           to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:

23:022:013 And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep,
           eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to
           morrow we shall die.

23:022:014 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely
           this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith
           the Lord GOD of hosts.

23:022:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this
           treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,

23:022:016 What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast
           hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a
           sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself
           in a rock?

23:022:017 Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity,
           and will surely cover thee.

23:022:018 He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
           large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of
           thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house.

23:022:019 And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state
           shall he pull thee down.

23:022:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my
           servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:

23:022:021 And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with
           thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand:
           and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
           to the house of Judah.

23:022:022 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his
           shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall
           shut, and none shall open.

23:022:023 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall
           be for a glorious throne to his father's house.

23:022:024 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's
           house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small
           quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of
           flagons.

23:022:025 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is
           fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and
           fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for
           the LORD hath spoken it.

23:023:001 The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid
           waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the
           land of Chittim it is revealed to them.

23:023:002 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants
           of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.

23:023:003 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the
           river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.

23:023:004 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the
           strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth
           children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up
           virgins.

23:023:005 As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely
           pained at the report of Tyre.

23:023:006 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.

23:023:007 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days?
           her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.

23:023:008 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,
           whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the
           honourable of the earth?

23:023:009 The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all
           glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the
           earth.

23:023:010 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish:
           there is no more strength.

23:023:011 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms:
           the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city,
           to destroy the strong holds thereof.

23:023:012 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed
           virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there
           also shalt thou have no rest.

23:023:013 Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till
           the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness:
           they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces
           thereof; and he brought it to ruin.

23:023:014 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.

23:023:015 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be
           forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king:
           after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.

23:023:016 Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been
           forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou
           mayest be remembered.

23:023:017 And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that
           the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and
           shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world
           upon the face of the earth.

23:023:018 And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the
           LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her
           merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to
           eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

23:024:001 Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste,
           and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the
           inhabitants thereof.

23:024:002 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as
           with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so
           with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as
           with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of
           usury, so with the giver of usury to him.

23:024:003 The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for
           the LORD hath spoken this word.

23:024:004 The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and
           fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.

23:024:005 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;
           because they have transgressed the laws, changed the
           ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

23:024:006 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that
           dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the
           earth are burned, and few men left.

23:024:007 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the
           merryhearted do sigh.

23:024:008 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
           endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.

23:024:009 They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be
           bitter to them that drink it.

23:024:010 The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up,
           that no man may come in.

23:024:011 There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is
           darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.

23:024:012 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
           destruction.

23:024:013 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the
           people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as
           the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.

23:024:014 They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the
           majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

23:024:015 Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of
           the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.

23:024:016 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even
           glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness,
           woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously;
           yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

23:024:017 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant
           of the earth.

23:024:018 And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise
           of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out
           of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the
           windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the
           earth do shake.

23:024:019 The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean
           dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.

23:024:020 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be
           removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be
           heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

23:024:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
           punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the
           kings of the earth upon the earth.

23:024:022 And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
           in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many
           days shall they be visited.

23:024:023 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when
           the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem,
           and before his ancients gloriously.

23:025:001 O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy
           name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old
           are faithfulness and truth.

23:025:002 For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a
           ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be
           built.

23:025:003 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of
           the terrible nations shall fear thee.

23:025:004 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
           needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from
           the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm
           against the wall.

23:025:005 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a
           dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the
           branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.

23:025:006 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all
           people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of
           fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

23:025:007 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
           cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all
           nations.

23:025:008 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will
           wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his
           people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD
           hath spoken it.

23:025:009 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
           waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have
           waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

23:025:010 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab
           shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down
           for the dunghill.

23:025:011 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as
           he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he
           shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their
           hands.

23:025:012 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring
           down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

23:026:001 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We
           have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and
           bulwarks.

23:026:002 Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the
           truth may enter in.

23:026:003 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
           thee: because he trusteth in thee.

23:026:004 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
           everlasting strength:

23:026:005 For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city,
           he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he
           bringeth it even to the dust.

23:026:006 The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and
           the steps of the needy.

23:026:007 The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost
           weigh the path of the just.

23:026:008 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for
           thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the
           remembrance of thee.

23:026:009 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my
           spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy
           judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will
           learn righteousness.

23:026:010 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
           righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal
           unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.

23:026:011 LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they
           shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea,
           the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.

23:026:012 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast
           wrought all our works in us.

23:026:013 O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over
           us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

23:026:014 They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they
           shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed
           them, and made all their memory to perish.

23:026:015 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased
           the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto
           all the ends of the earth.

23:026:016 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a
           prayer when thy chastening was upon them.

23:026:017 Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her
           delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we
           been in thy sight, O LORD.

23:026:018 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it
           were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance
           in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world
           fallen.

23:026:019 Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
           arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is
           as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

23:026:020 Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
           doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment,
           until the indignation be overpast.

23:026:021 For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the
           inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also
           shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

23:027:001 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword
           shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan
           that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in
           the sea.

23:027:002 In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.

23:027:003 I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
           hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

23:027:004 Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against
           me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them
           together.

23:027:005 Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace
           with me; and he shall make peace with me.

23:027:006 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel
           shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with
           fruit.

23:027:007 Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is
           he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by
           him?

23:027:008 In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it:
           he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.

23:027:009 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and
           this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all
           the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in
           sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.

23:027:010 Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation
           forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf
           feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches
           thereof.

23:027:011 When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken
           off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people
           of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have
           mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no
           favour.

23:027:012 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
           beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of
           Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of
           Israel.

23:027:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet
           shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish
           in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,
           and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.

23:028:001 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
           glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of
           the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!

23:028:002 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a
           tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty
           waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the
           hand.

23:028:003 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden
           under feet:

23:028:004 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat
           valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit
           before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth,
           while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.

23:028:005 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory,
           and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,

23:028:006 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment,
           and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.

23:028:007 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong
           drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have
           erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine,
           they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in
           vision, they stumble in judgment.

23:028:008 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there
           is no place clean.

23:028:009 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
           understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and
           drawn from the breasts.

23:028:010 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
           upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:

23:028:011 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to
           this people.

23:028:012 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
           weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not
           hear.

23:028:013 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,
           precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a
           little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall
           backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

23:028:014 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that
           rule this people which is in Jerusalem.

23:028:015 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and
           with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge
           shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have
           made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid
           ourselves:

23:028:016 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
           foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a
           sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.

23:028:017 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
           plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and
           the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

23:028:018 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
           agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing
           scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by
           it.

23:028:019 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for
           morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night:
           and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.

23:028:020 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
           it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in
           it.

23:028:021 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be
           wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his
           strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

23:028:022 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made
           strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a
           consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.

23:028:023 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.

23:028:024 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break
           the clods of his ground?

23:028:025 When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast
           abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the
           principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their
           place?

23:028:026 For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach
           him.

23:028:027 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
           neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the
           fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a
           rod.

23:028:028 Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing
           it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it
           with his horsemen.

23:028:029 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is
           wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.

23:029:001 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye
           year to year; let them kill sacrifices.

23:029:002 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and
           sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.

23:029:003 And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege
           against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against
           thee.

23:029:004 And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the
           ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy
           voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of
           the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.

23:029:005 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small
           dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff
           that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.

23:029:006 Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and
           with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and
           the flame of devouring fire.

23:029:007 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
           even all that fight against her and her munition, and that
           distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.

23:029:008 It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold,
           he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a
           thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he
           awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite:
           so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight
           against mount Zion.

23:029:009 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
           drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong
           drink.

23:029:010 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep
           sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your
           rulers, the seers hath he covered.

23:029:011 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a
           book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned,
           saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it
           is sealed:

23:029:012 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying,
           Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.

23:029:013 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me
           with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have
           removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is
           taught by the precept of men:

23:029:014 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work
           among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for
           the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the
           understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.

23:029:015 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
           LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth
           us? and who knoweth us?

23:029:016 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as
           the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it,
           He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that
           framed it, He had no understanding?

23:029:017 Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned
           into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be
           esteemed as a forest?

23:029:018 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and
           the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of
           darkness.

23:029:019 The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the
           poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

23:029:020 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is
           consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:

23:029:021 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for
           him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a
           thing of nought.

23:029:022 Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham,
           concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed,
           neither shall his face now wax pale.

23:029:023 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the
           midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the
           Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

23:029:024 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,
           and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.

23:030:001 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take
           counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but
           not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:

23:030:002 That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my
           mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
           and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!

23:030:003 Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the
           trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

23:030:004 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to
           Hanes.

23:030:005 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them,
           nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

23:030:006 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of
           trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion,
           the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their
           riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures
           upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit
           them.

23:030:007 For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
           therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to
           sit still.

23:030:008 Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a
           book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

23:030:009 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children
           that will not hear the law of the LORD:

23:030:010 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy
           not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things,
           prophesy deceits:

23:030:011 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the
           Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

23:030:012 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye
           despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness,
           and stay thereon:

23:030:013 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
           fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh
           suddenly at an instant.

23:030:014 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel
           that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there
           shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire
           from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.

23:030:015 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In
           returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in
           confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.

23:030:016 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall
           ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall
           they that pursue you be swift.

23:030:017 One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
           five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top
           of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.

23:030:018 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
           you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy
           upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all
           they that wait for him.

23:030:019 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt
           weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice
           of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.

23:030:020 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
           water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed
           into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:

23:030:021 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is
           the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and
           when ye turn to the left.

23:030:022 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
           silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou
           shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say
           unto it, Get thee hence.

23:030:023 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow
           the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and
           it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle
           feed in large pastures.

23:030:024 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground
           shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the
           shovel and with the fan.

23:030:025 And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every
           high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the
           great slaughter, when the towers fall.

23:030:026 Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the
           sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light
           of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach
           of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.

23:030:027 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
           anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of
           indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:

23:030:028 And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the
           midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of
           vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people,
           causing them to err.

23:030:029 Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is
           kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to
           come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of
           Israel.

23:030:030 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and
           shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation
           of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with
           scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.

23:030:031 For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten
           down, which smote with a rod.

23:030:032 And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which
           the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and
           harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.

23:030:033 For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is
           prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is
           fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of
           brimstone, doth kindle it.

23:031:001 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on
           horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in
           horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto
           the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!

23:031:002 Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call
           back his words: but will arise against the house of the
           evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.

23:031:003 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses
           flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his
           hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen
           shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.

23:031:004 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and
           the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of
           shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid
           of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so
           shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and
           for the hill thereof.

23:031:005 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;
           defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will
           preserve it.

23:031:006 Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply
           revolted.

23:031:007 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver,
           and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you
           for a sin.

23:031:008 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty
           man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but
           he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be
           discomfited.

23:031:009 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his
           princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose
           fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.

23:032:001 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
           rule in judgment.

23:032:002 And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a
           covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as
           the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

23:032:003 And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears
           of them that hear shall hearken.

23:032:004 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the
           tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

23:032:005 The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl
           said to be bountiful.

23:032:006 For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will
           work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error
           against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he
           will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

23:032:007 The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
           devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the
           needy speaketh right.

23:032:008 But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things
           shall he stand.

23:032:009 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless
           daughters; give ear unto my speech.

23:032:010 Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women:
           for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

23:032:011 Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless
           ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon
           your loins.

23:032:012 They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for
           the fruitful vine.

23:032:013 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers;
           yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:

23:032:014 Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the
           city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for
           ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

23:032:015 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the
           wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be
           counted for a forest.

23:032:016 Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
           remain in the fruitful field.

23:032:017 And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect
           of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.

23:032:018 And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in
           sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;

23:032:019 When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city
           shall be low in a low place.

23:032:020 Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth
           thither the feet of the ox and the ass.

23:033:001 Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and
           dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with
           thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled;
           and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they
           shall deal treacherously with thee.

23:033:002 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
           their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of
           trouble.

23:033:003 At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up
           of thyself the nations were scattered.

23:033:004 And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the
           caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run
           upon them.

23:033:005 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled
           Zion with judgment and righteousness.

23:033:006 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,
           and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his
           treasure.

23:033:007 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors
           of peace shall weep bitterly.

23:033:008 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath
           broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth
           no man.

23:033:009 The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and
           hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel
           shake off their fruits.

23:033:010 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now
           will I lift up myself.

23:033:011 Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your
           breath, as fire, shall devour you.

23:033:012 And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut
           up shall they be burned in the fire.

23:033:013 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are
           near, acknowledge my might.

23:033:014 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
           hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
           who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

23:033:015 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that
           despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from
           holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of
           blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

23:033:016 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the
           munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall
           be sure.

23:033:017 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold
           the land that is very far off.

23:033:018 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where
           is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?

23:033:019 Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper
           speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that
           thou canst not understand.

23:033:020 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall
           see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not
           be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be
           removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.

23:033:021 But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad
           rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars,
           neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.

23:033:022 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD
           is our king; he will save us.

23:033:023 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their
           mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a
           great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.

23:033:024 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that
           dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.

23:034:001 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let
           the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all
           things that come forth of it.

23:034:002 For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his
           fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he
           hath delivered them to the slaughter.

23:034:003 Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come
           up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted
           with their blood.

23:034:004 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens
           shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall
           fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a
           falling fig from the fig tree.

23:034:005 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come
           down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to
           judgment.

23:034:006 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat
           with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the
           fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in
           Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.

23:034:007 And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks
           with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and
           their dust made fat with fatness.

23:034:008 For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of
           recompences for the controversy of Zion.

23:034:009 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the
           dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become
           burning pitch.

23:034:010 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof
           shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall
           lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.

23:034:011 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl
           also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out
           upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

23:034:012 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none
           shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

23:034:013 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles
           in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of
           dragons, and a court for owls.

23:034:014 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
           beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow;
           the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a
           place of rest.

23:034:015 There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch,
           and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be
           gathered, every one with her mate.

23:034:016 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these
           shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath
           commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.

23:034:017 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided
           it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from
           generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

23:035:001 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;
           and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

23:035:002 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
           singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the
           excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of
           the LORD, and the excellency of our God.

23:035:003 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

23:035:004 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
           behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a
           recompence; he will come and save you.

23:035:005 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of
           the deaf shall be unstopped.

23:035:006 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
           dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and
           streams in the desert.

23:035:007 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty
           land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where
           each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.

23:035:008 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be
           called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over
           it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though
           fools, shall not err therein.

23:035:009 No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up
           thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall
           walk there:

23:035:010 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion
           with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall
           obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
           away.

23:036:001 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
           that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the
           defenced cities of Judah, and took them.

23:036:002 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to
           Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood
           by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the
           fuller's field.

23:036:003 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was
           over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son,
           the recorder.

23:036:004 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
           saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
           this wherein thou trustest?

23:036:005 I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have
           counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust,
           that thou rebellest against me?

23:036:006 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt;
           whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce
           it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.

23:036:007 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not
           he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken
           away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship
           before this altar?

23:036:008 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king
           of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou
           be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

23:036:009 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
           least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
           chariots and for horsemen?

23:036:010 And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to
           destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land,
           and destroy it.

23:036:011 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I
           pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we
           understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in
           the ears of the people that are on the wall.

23:036:012 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and
           to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men
           that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and
           drink their own piss with you?

23:036:013 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
           language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the
           king of Assyria.

23:036:014 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
           shall not be able to deliver you.

23:036:015 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
           LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered
           into the hand of the king of Assyria.

23:036:016 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
           Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me:
           and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig
           tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;

23:036:017 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
           land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

23:036:018 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will
           deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his
           land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

23:036:019 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of
           Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

23:036:020 Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have
           delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should
           deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

23:036:021 But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for
           the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

23:036:022 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the
           household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph,
           the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told
           him the words of Rabshakeh.

23:037:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
           his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
           the house of the LORD.

23:037:002 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna
           the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with
           sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

23:037:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
           of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children
           are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring
           forth.

23:037:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
           whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the
           living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God
           hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that
           is left.

23:037:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

23:037:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,
           Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast
           heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have
           blasphemed me.

23:037:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
           rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to
           fall by the sword in his own land.

23:037:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
           against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
           Lachish.

23:037:009 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is
           come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he
           sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

23:037:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not
           thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying,
           Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of
           Assyria.

23:037:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
           all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be
           delivered?

23:037:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
           have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
           children of Eden which were in Telassar?

23:037:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the
           king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

23:037:014 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the
           messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house
           of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

23:037:015 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,

23:037:016 O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the
           cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the
           kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.

23:037:017 Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD,
           and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath
           sent to reproach the living God.

23:037:018 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
           nations, and their countries,

23:037:019 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods,
           but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
           have destroyed them.

23:037:020 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all
           the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD,
           even thou only.

23:037:021 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
           saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me
           against Sennacherib king of Assyria:

23:037:022 This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him;
           The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and
           laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken
           her head at thee.

23:037:023 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
           hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
           even against the Holy One of Israel.

23:037:024 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said,
           By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of
           the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down
           the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and
           I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of
           his Carmel.

23:037:025 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet
           have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

23:037:026 Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of
           ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
           pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into
           ruinous heaps.

23:037:027 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
           dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field,
           and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as
           corn blasted before it be grown up.

23:037:028 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
           and thy rage against me.

23:037:029 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into
           mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my
           bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
           which thou camest.

23:037:030 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year
           such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which
           springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap,
           and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.

23:037:031 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
           again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

23:037:032 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
           escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall
           do this.

23:037:033 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
           He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
           nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.

23:037:034 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
           shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

23:037:035 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and
           for my servant David's sake.

23:037:036 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp
           of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand:
           and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were
           all dead corpses.

23:037:037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
           returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

23:037:038 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
           Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
           him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia:
           and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

23:038:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the
           prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus
           saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die,
           and not live.

23:038:002 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto
           the LORD,

23:038:003 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have
           walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have
           done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

23:038:004 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,

23:038:005 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David
           thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears:
           behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

23:038:006 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the
           king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.

23:038:007 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the
           LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;

23:038:008 Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is
           gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So
           the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone
           down.

23:038:009 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick,
           and was recovered of his sickness:

23:038:010 I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates
           of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.

23:038:011 I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land
           of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants
           of the world.

23:038:012 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's
           tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off
           with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an
           end of me.

23:038:013 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all
           my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

23:038:014 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
           dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am
           oppressed; undertake for me.

23:038:015 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself
           hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness
           of my soul.

23:038:016 O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is
           the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to
           live.

23:038:017 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in
           love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for
           thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.

23:038:018 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate
           thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy
           truth.

23:038:019 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this
           day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

23:038:020 The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs
           to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the
           house of the LORD.

23:038:021 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it
           for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.

23:038:022 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to
           the house of the LORD?

23:039:001 At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
           Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had
           heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.

23:039:002 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of
           his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices,
           and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour,
           and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in
           his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them
           not.

23:039:003 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
           him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
           And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me,
           even from Babylon.

23:039:004 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
           answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is
           nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.

23:039:005 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of
           hosts:

23:039:006 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and
           that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day,
           shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the
           LORD.

23:039:007 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
           beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
           palace of the king of Babylon.

23:039:008 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
           which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be
           peace and truth in my days.

23:040:001 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

23:040:002 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
           warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for
           she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.

23:040:003 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
           way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our
           God.

23:040:004 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill
           shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and
           the rough places plain:

23:040:005 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh
           shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken
           it.

23:040:006 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh
           is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of
           the field:

23:040:007 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of
           the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.

23:040:008 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our
           God shall stand for ever.

23:040:009 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
           mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy
           voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the
           cities of Judah, Behold your God!

23:040:010 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm
           shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his
           work before him.

23:040:011 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
           lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall
           gently lead those that are with young.

23:040:012 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and
           meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of
           the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
           and the hills in a balance?

23:040:013 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his
           counsellor hath taught him?

23:040:014 With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught
           him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and
           shewed to him the way of understanding?

23:040:015 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
           as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the
           isles as a very little thing.

23:040:016 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
           sufficient for a burnt offering.

23:040:017 All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to
           him less than nothing, and vanity.

23:040:018 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye
           compare unto him?

23:040:019 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith
           spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

23:040:020 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a
           tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman
           to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.

23:040:021 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told
           you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the
           foundations of the earth?

23:040:022 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
           inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out
           the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to
           dwell in:

23:040:023 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of
           the earth as vanity.

23:040:024 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
           yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he
           shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the
           whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

23:040:025 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the
           Holy One.

23:040:026 Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
           things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth
           them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he
           is strong in power; not one faileth.

23:040:027 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is
           hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?

23:040:028 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting
           God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth
           not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his
           understanding.

23:040:029 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
           he increaseth strength.

23:040:030 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men
           shall utterly fall:

23:040:031 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength;
           they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and
           not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

23:041:001 Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew
           their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let
           us come near together to judgment.

23:041:002 Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to
           his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over
           kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven
           stubble to his bow.

23:041:003 He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he
           had not gone with his feet.

23:041:004 Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the
           beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.

23:041:005 The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were
           afraid, drew near, and came.

23:041:006 They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his
           brother, Be of good courage.

23:041:007 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that
           smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It
           is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that
           it should not be moved.

23:041:008 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
           the seed of Abraham my friend.

23:041:009 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called
           thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art
           my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

23:041:010 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am
           thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I
           will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.

23:041:011 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be
           ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they
           that strive with thee shall perish.

23:041:012 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that
           contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as
           nothing, and as a thing of nought.

23:041:013 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto
           thee, Fear not; I will help thee.

23:041:014 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help
           thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of
           Israel.

23:041:015 Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument
           having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them
           small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.

23:041:016 Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and
           the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in
           the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.

23:041:017 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and
           their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I
           the God of Israel will not forsake them.

23:041:018 I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst
           of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
           and the dry land springs of water.

23:041:019 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree,
           and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the
           fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:

23:041:020 That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand
           together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the
           Holy One of Israel hath created it.

23:041:021 Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong
           reasons, saith the King of Jacob.

23:041:022 Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let
           them shew the former things, what they be, that we may
           consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us
           things for to come.

23:041:023 Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know
           that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be
           dismayed, and behold it together.

23:041:024 Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an
           abomination is he that chooseth you.

23:041:025 I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from
           the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall
           come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth
           clay.

23:041:026 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and
           beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is
           none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea,
           there is none that heareth your words.

23:041:027 The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will
           give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.

23:041:028 For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there
           was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a
           word.

23:041:029 Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their
           molten images are wind and confusion.

23:042:001 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
           delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring
           forth judgment to the Gentiles.

23:042:002 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard
           in the street.

23:042:003 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall
           he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

23:042:004 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set
           judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

23:042:005 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and
           stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that
           which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people
           upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

23:042:006 I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold
           thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant
           of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

23:042:007 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
           prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

23:042:008 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give
           to another, neither my praise to graven images.

23:042:009 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do
           I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

23:042:010 Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of
           the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is
           therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

23:042:011 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,
           the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of
           the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

23:042:012 Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in
           the islands.

23:042:013 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up
           jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall
           prevail against his enemies.

23:042:014 I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and
           refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I
           will destroy and devour at once.

23:042:015 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their
           herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up
           the pools.

23:042:016 And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
           lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make
           darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These
           things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

23:042:017 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that
           trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are
           our gods.

23:042:018 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

23:042:019 Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I
           sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the
           LORD's servant?

23:042:020 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears,
           but he heareth not.

23:042:021 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will
           magnify the law, and make it honourable.

23:042:022 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them
           snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are
           for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith,
           Restore.

23:042:023 Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear
           for the time to come?

23:042:024 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not
           the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not
           walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

23:042:025 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and
           the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round
           about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not
           to heart.

23:043:001 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he
           that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed
           thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.

23:043:002 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
           through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou
           walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither
           shall the flame kindle upon thee.

23:043:003 For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
           Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for
           thee.

23:043:004 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been
           honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men
           for thee, and people for thy life.

23:043:005 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the
           east, and gather thee from the west;

23:043:006 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not
           back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends
           of the earth;

23:043:007 Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created
           him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

23:043:008 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that
           have ears.

23:043:009 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people
           be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us
           former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they
           may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.

23:043:010 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I
           have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand
           that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall
           there be after me.

23:043:011 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.

23:043:012 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there
           was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses,
           saith the LORD, that I am God.

23:043:013 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can
           deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

23:043:014 Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
           For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down
           all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the
           ships.

23:043:015 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your
           King.

23:043:016 Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path
           in the mighty waters;

23:043:017 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the
           power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they
           are extinct, they are quenched as tow.

23:043:018 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things
           of old.

23:043:019 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth;
           shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the
           wilderness, and rivers in the desert.

23:043:020 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the
           owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in
           the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.

23:043:021 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
           praise.

23:043:022 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been
           weary of me, O Israel.

23:043:023 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt
           offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices.
           I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied
           thee with incense.

23:043:024 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast
           thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast
           made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with
           thine iniquities.

23:043:025 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
           own sake, and will not remember thy sins.

23:043:026 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou,
           that thou mayest be justified.

23:043:027 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have
           transgressed against me.

23:043:028 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and
           have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

23:044:001 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have
           chosen:

23:044:002 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the
           womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and
           thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

23:044:003 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
           upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and
           my blessing upon thine offspring:

23:044:004 And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the
           water courses.

23:044:005 One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself
           by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his
           hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.

23:044:006 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the
           LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside
           me there is no God.

23:044:007 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in
           order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the
           things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto
           them.

23:044:008 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that
           time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there
           a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.

23:044:009 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and
           their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their
           own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be
           ashamed.

23:044:010 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is
           profitable for nothing?

23:044:011 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen,
           they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them
           stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed
           together.

23:044:012 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and
           fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength
           of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he
           drinketh no water, and is faint.

23:044:013 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with
           a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with
           the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man,
           according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the
           house.

23:044:014 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,
           which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the
           forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.

23:044:015 Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof,
           and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea,
           he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven
           image, and falleth down thereto.

23:044:016 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he
           eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he
           warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the
           fire:

23:044:017 And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven
           image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and
           prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.

23:044:018 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their
           eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot
           understand.

23:044:019 And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge
           nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the
           fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I
           have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue
           thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a
           tree?

23:044:020 He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside,
           that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie
           in my right hand?

23:044:021 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I
           have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt
           not be forgotten of me.

23:044:022 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,
           as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed
           thee.

23:044:023 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower
           parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O
           forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed
           Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.

23:044:024 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee
           from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that
           stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the
           earth by myself;

23:044:025 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners
           mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their
           knowledge foolish;

23:044:026 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the
           counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt
           be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built,
           and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:

23:044:027 That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:

23:044:028 That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all
           my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built;
           and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

23:045:001 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right
           hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will
           loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved
           gates; and the gates shall not be shut;

23:045:002 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I
           will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the
           bars of iron:

23:045:003 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden
           riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the
           LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.

23:045:004 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have
           even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though
           thou hast not known me.

23:045:005 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside
           me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:

23:045:006 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the
           west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there
           is none else.

23:045:007 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and
           create evil: I the LORD do all these things.

23:045:008 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
           righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth
           salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the
           LORD have created it.

23:045:009 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd
           strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to
           him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath
           no hands?

23:045:010 Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou?
           or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?

23:045:011 Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker,
           Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning
           the work of my hands command ye me.

23:045:012 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my
           hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have
           I commanded.

23:045:013 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all
           his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my
           captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.

23:045:014 Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of
           Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over
           unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after
           thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down
           unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying,
           Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no
           God.

23:045:015 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel,
           the Saviour.

23:045:016 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they
           shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.

23:045:017 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting
           salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world
           without end.

23:045:018 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself
           that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he
           created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the
           LORD; and there is none else.

23:045:019 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I
           said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the
           LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

23:045:020 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are
           escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the
           wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot
           save.

23:045:021 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel
           together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath
           told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no
           God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none
           beside me.

23:045:022 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for
           I am God, and there is none else.

23:045:023 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
           righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee
           shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

23:045:024 Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and
           strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are
           incensed against him shall be ashamed.

23:045:025 In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and
           shall glory.

23:046:001 Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the
           beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden;
           they are a burden to the weary beast.

23:046:002 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
           burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.

23:046:003 Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the
           house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which
           are carried from the womb:

23:046:004 And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will
           I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry,
           and will deliver you.

23:046:005 To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me,
           that we may be like?

23:046:006 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the
           balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they
           fall down, yea, they worship.

23:046:007 They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him
           in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not
           remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer,
           nor save him out of his trouble.

23:046:008 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to
           mind, O ye transgressors.

23:046:009 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is
           none else; I am God, and there is none like me,

23:046:010 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
           the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall
           stand, and I will do all my pleasure:

23:046:011 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth
           my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will
           also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.

23:046:012 Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from
           righteousness:

23:046:013 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my
           salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion
           for Israel my glory.

23:047:001 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon,
           sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the
           Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and
           delicate.

23:047:002 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make
           bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

23:047:003 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be
           seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a
           man.

23:047:004 As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy
           One of Israel.

23:047:005 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the
           Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of
           kingdoms.

23:047:006 I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance,
           and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy;
           upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

23:047:007 And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou
           didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst
           remember the latter end of it.

23:047:008 Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures,
           that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am,
           and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither
           shall I know the loss of children:

23:047:009 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one
           day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon
           thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries,
           and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.

23:047:010 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None
           seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted
           thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else
           beside me.

23:047:011 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from
           whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou
           shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come
           upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.

23:047:012 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of
           thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if
           so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest
           prevail.

23:047:013 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
           astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,
           stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon
           thee.

23:047:014 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them;
           they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:
           there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before
           it.

23:047:015 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured,
           even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every
           one to his quarter; none shall save thee.

23:048:001 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name
           of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah,
           which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the
           God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.

23:048:002 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves
           upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.

23:048:003 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they
           went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them
           suddenly, and they came to pass.

23:048:004 Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an
           iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

23:048:005 I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it
           came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine
           idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image,
           hath commanded them.

23:048:006 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I
           have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden
           things, and thou didst not know them.

23:048:007 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before
           the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say,
           Behold, I knew them.

23:048:008 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
           time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou
           wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a
           transgressor from the womb.

23:048:009 For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise
           will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.

23:048:010 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have
           chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.

23:048:011 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for
           how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory
           unto another.

23:048:012 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am
           the first, I also am the last.

23:048:013 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my
           right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them,
           they stand up together.

23:048:014 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath
           declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his
           pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.

23:048:015 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought
           him, and he shall make his way prosperous.

23:048:016 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in
           secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am
           I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

23:048:017 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I
           am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which
           leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.

23:048:018 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
           peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of
           the sea:

23:048:019 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
           bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been
           cut off nor destroyed from before me.

23:048:020 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a
           voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the
           end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant
           Jacob.

23:048:021 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he
           caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave
           the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

23:048:022 There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.

23:049:001 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;
           The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my
           mother hath he made mention of my name.

23:049:002 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
           his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his
           quiver hath he hid me;

23:049:003 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I
           will be glorified.

23:049:004 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength
           for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the
           LORD, and my work with my God.

23:049:005 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his
           servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not
           gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and
           my God shall be my strength.

23:049:006 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
           servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the
           preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the
           Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the
           earth.

23:049:007 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,
           to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth,
           to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes
           also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and
           the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.

23:049:008 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee,
           and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will
           preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to
           establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
           heritages;

23:049:009 That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that
           are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways,
           and their pastures shall be in all high places.

23:049:010 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor
           sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead
           them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.

23:049:011 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall
           be exalted.

23:049:012 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the
           north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

23:049:013 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
           singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people,
           and will have mercy upon his afflicted.

23:049:014 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
           forgotten me.

23:049:015 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
           compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet
           will I not forget thee.

23:049:016 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy
           walls are continually before me.

23:049:017 Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that
           made thee waste shall go forth of thee.

23:049:018 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather
           themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the
           LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an
           ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.

23:049:019 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
           destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the
           inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far
           away.

23:049:020 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the
           other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait
           for me: give place to me that I may dwell.

23:049:021 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me
           these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a
           captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up
           these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?

23:049:022 Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to
           the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they
           shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be
           carried upon their shoulders.

23:049:023 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
           nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face
           toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou
           shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed
           that wait for me.

23:049:024 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
           delivered?

23:049:025 But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall
           be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be
           delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with
           thee, and I will save thy children.

23:049:026 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh;
           and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet
           wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour
           and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

23:050:001 Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's
           divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is
           it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have
           ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother
           put away.

23:050:002 Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was
           there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it
           cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my
           rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their
           fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for
           thirst.

23:050:003 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
           their covering.

23:050:004 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I
           should know how to speak a word in season to him that is
           weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to
           hear as the learned.

23:050:005 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
           neither turned away back.

23:050:006 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that
           plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and
           spitting.

23:050:007 For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be
           confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I
           know that I shall not be ashamed.

23:050:008 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let
           us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to
           me.

23:050:009 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall
           condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth
           shall eat them up.

23:050:010 Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice
           of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light?
           let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.

23:050:011 Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves
           about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the
           sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand;
           ye shall lie down in sorrow.

23:051:001 Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that
           seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to
           the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.

23:051:002 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you:
           for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

23:051:003 For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste
           places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her
           desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be
           found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

23:051:004 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation:
           for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment
           to rest for a light of the people.

23:051:005 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
           arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and
           on mine arm shall they trust.

23:051:006 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
           beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the
           earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell
           therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be
           for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

23:051:007 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in
           whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men,
           neither be ye afraid of their revilings.

23:051:008 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm
           shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for
           ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.

23:051:009 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in
           the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it
           that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?

23:051:010 Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the
           great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the
           ransomed to pass over?

23:051:011 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with
           singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their
           head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and
           mourning shall flee away.

23:051:012 I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
           shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of
           man which shall be made as grass;

23:051:013 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth
           the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast
           feared continually every day because of the fury of the
           oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the
           fury of the oppressor?

23:051:014 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he
           should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.

23:051:015 But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves
           roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.

23:051:016 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee
           in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and
           lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art
           my people.

23:051:017 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the
           hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the
           dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.

23:051:018 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath
           brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the
           hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.

23:051:019 These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for
           thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the
           sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?

23:051:020 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the
           streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of
           the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.

23:051:021 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not
           with wine:

23:051:022 Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the
           cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand
           the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury;
           thou shalt no more drink it again:

23:051:023 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee;
           which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over:
           and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street,
           to them that went over.

23:052:001 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy
           beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth
           there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the
           unclean.

23:052:002 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem:
           loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter
           of Zion.

23:052:003 For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought;
           and ye shall be redeemed without money.

23:052:004 For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime
           into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them
           without cause.

23:052:005 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my
           people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make
           them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every
           day is blasphemed.

23:052:006 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall
           know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is
           I.

23:052:007 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
           bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth
           good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith
           unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!

23:052:008 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together
           shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD
           shall bring again Zion.

23:052:009 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of
           Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath
           redeemed Jerusalem.

23:052:010 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
           nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation
           of our God.

23:052:011 Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean
           thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear
           the vessels of the LORD.

23:052:012 For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the
           LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your
           rereward.

23:052:013 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted
           and extolled, and be very high.

23:052:014 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more
           than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:

23:052:015 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their
           mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall
           they see; and that which they had not heard shall they
           consider.

23:053:001 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the
           LORD revealed?

23:053:002 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a
           root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
           when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should
           desire him.

23:053:003 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
           acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from
           him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

23:053:004 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet
           we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

23:053:005 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
           our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him;
           and with his stripes we are healed.

23:053:006 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one
           to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of
           us all.

23:053:007 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
           mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
           sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his
           mouth.

23:053:008 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall
           declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of
           the living: for the transgression of my people was he
           stricken.

23:053:009 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in
           his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any
           deceit in his mouth.

23:053:010 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to
           grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he
           shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the
           pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.

23:053:011 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
           satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify
           many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

23:053:012 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
           shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured
           out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the
           transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made
           intercession for the transgressors.

23:054:001 Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into
           singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with
           child: for more are the children of the desolate than the
           children of the married wife, saith the LORD.

23:054:002 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the
           curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords,
           and strengthen thy stakes;

23:054:003 For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left;
           and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate
           cities to be inhabited.

23:054:004 Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou
           confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt
           forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the
           reproach of thy widowhood any more.

23:054:005 For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name;
           and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole
           earth shall he be called.

23:054:006 For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved
           in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith
           thy God.

23:054:007 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great
           mercies will I gather thee.

23:054:008 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but
           with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the
           LORD thy Redeemer.

23:054:009 For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn
           that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so
           have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke
           thee.

23:054:010 For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but
           my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the
           covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath
           mercy on thee.

23:054:011 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,
           behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy
           foundations with sapphires.

23:054:012 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of
           carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

23:054:013 And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great
           shall be the peace of thy children.

23:054:014 In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far
           from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for
           it shall not come near thee.

23:054:015 Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me:
           whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for
           thy sake.

23:054:016 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
           fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and
           I have created the waster to destroy.

23:054:017 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every
           tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt
           condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and
           their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.

23:055:001 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he
           that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine
           and milk without money and without price.

23:055:002 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and
           your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently
           unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul
           delight itself in fatness.

23:055:003 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall
           live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even
           the sure mercies of David.

23:055:004 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader
           and commander to the people.

23:055:005 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and
           nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the
           LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath
           glorified thee.

23:055:006 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while
           he is near:

23:055:007 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
           thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have
           mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

23:055:008 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
           my ways, saith the LORD.

23:055:009 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
           higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

23:055:010 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
           returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it
           bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and
           bread to the eater:

23:055:011 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall
           not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I
           please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

23:055:012 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the
           mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into
           singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their
           hands.

23:055:013 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead
           of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to
           the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be
           cut off.

23:056:001 Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my
           salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be
           revealed.

23:056:002 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that
           layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,
           and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.

23:056:003 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself
           to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me
           from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a
           dry tree.

23:056:004 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my
           sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold
           of my covenant;

23:056:005 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a
           place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will
           give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.

23:056:006 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the
           LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be
           his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from
           polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;

23:056:007 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them
           joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their
           sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house
           shall be called an house of prayer for all people.

23:056:008 The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith,
           Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are
           gathered unto him.

23:056:009 All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts
           in the forest.

23:056:010 His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all
           dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to
           slumber.

23:056:011 Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and
           they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to
           their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.

23:056:012 Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill
           ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this
           day, and much more abundant.

23:057:001 The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and
           merciful men are taken away, none considering that the
           righteous is taken away from the evil to come.

23:057:002 He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each
           one walking in his uprightness.

23:057:003 But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of
           the adulterer and the whore.

23:057:004 Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a
           wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of
           transgression, a seed of falsehood.

23:057:005 Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree,
           slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the
           rocks?

23:057:006 Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they,
           they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink
           offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive
           comfort in these?

23:057:007 Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even
           thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.

23:057:008 Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy
           remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than
           me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee
           a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest
           it.

23:057:009 And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase
           thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst
           debase thyself even unto hell.

23:057:010 Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou
           not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand;
           therefore thou wast not grieved.

23:057:011 And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast
           lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart?
           have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?

23:057:012 I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they
           shall not profit thee.

23:057:013 When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind
           shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that
           putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall
           inherit my holy mountain;

23:057:014 And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take
           up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

23:057:015 For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth
           eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy
           place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit,
           to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of
           the contrite ones.

23:057:016 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always
           wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls
           which I have made.

23:057:017 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote
           him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the
           way of his heart.

23:057:018 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also,
           and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

23:057:019 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is
           far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will
           heal him.

23:057:020 But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,
           whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

23:057:021 There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

23:058:001 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and
           shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob
           their sins.

23:058:002 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a
           nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance
           of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they
           take delight in approaching to God.

23:058:003 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?
           wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no
           knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure,
           and exact all your labours.

23:058:004 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the
           fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to
           make your voice to be heard on high.

23:058:005 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to
           afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and
           to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a
           fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?

23:058:006 Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of
           wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the
           oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?

23:058:007 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring
           the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the
           naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself
           from thine own flesh?

23:058:008 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine
           health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness
           shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy
           rereward.

23:058:009 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt
           cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the
           midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and
           speaking vanity;

23:058:010 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
           afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and
           thy darkness be as the noon day:

23:058:011 And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy
           soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be
           like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose
           waters fail not.

23:058:012 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste
           places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many
           generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the
           breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.

23:058:013 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
           pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the
           holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing
           thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking
           thine own words:

23:058:014 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause
           thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee
           with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the
           LORD hath spoken it.

23:059:001 Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;
           neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:

23:059:002 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
           and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not
           hear.

23:059:003 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
           iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath
           muttered perverseness.

23:059:004 None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they
           trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and
           bring forth iniquity.

23:059:005 They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he
           that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed
           breaketh out into a viper.

23:059:006 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
           themselves with their works: their works are works of
           iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.

23:059:007 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent
           blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and
           destruction are in their paths.

23:059:008 The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in
           their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever
           goeth therein shall not know peace.

23:059:009 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice
           overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for
           brightness, but we walk in darkness.

23:059:010 We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we
           had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in
           desolate places as dead men.

23:059:011 We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for
           judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off
           from us.

23:059:012 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our
           sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us;
           and as for our iniquities, we know them;

23:059:013 In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing
           away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving
           and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

23:059:014 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth
           afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot
           enter.

23:059:015 Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh
           himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him
           that there was no judgment.

23:059:016 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was
           no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him;
           and his righteousness, it sustained him.

23:059:017 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of
           salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of
           vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.

23:059:018 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to
           his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he
           will repay recompence.

23:059:019 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his
           glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in
           like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard
           against him.

23:059:020 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn
           from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.

23:059:021 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My
           spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
           mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth
           of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith
           the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.

23:060:001 Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD
           is risen upon thee.

23:060:002 For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
           darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and
           his glory shall be seen upon thee.

23:060:003 And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the
           brightness of thy rising.

23:060:004 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather
           themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come
           from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.

23:060:005 Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall
           fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall
           be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come
           unto thee.

23:060:006 The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of
           Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall
           bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises
           of the LORD.

23:060:007 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee,
           the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come
           up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house
           of my glory.

23:060:008 Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their
           windows?

23:060:009 Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish
           first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold
           with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy
           One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.

23:060:010 And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their
           kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee,
           but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.

23:060:011 Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not
           be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces
           of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.

23:060:012 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall
           perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.

23:060:013 The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the
           pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my
           sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.

23:060:014 The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending
           unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow
           themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call
           thee; The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of
           Israel.

23:060:015 Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went
           through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of
           many generations.

23:060:016 Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck
           the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am
           thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

23:060:017 For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,
           and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy
           officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.

23:060:018 Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor
           destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls
           Salvation, and thy gates Praise.

23:060:019 The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for
           brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD
           shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy
           glory.

23:060:020 Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw
           itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the
           days of thy mourning shall be ended.

23:060:021 Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the
           land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my
           hands, that I may be glorified.

23:060:022 A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong
           nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.

23:061:001 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath
           anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent
           me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the
           captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are
           bound;

23:061:002 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of
           vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;

23:061:003 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them
           beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
           praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called
           trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he
           might be glorified.

23:061:004 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
           former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities,
           the desolations of many generations.

23:061:005 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons
           of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

23:061:006 But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call
           you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the
           Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.

23:061:007 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they
           shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they
           shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.

23:061:008 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt
           offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will
           make an everlasting covenant with them.

23:061:009 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their
           offspring among the people: all that see them shall
           acknowledge them, that
